<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Rondah; or, Thirty-three Years in a Star</span>,” by Florence Carpenter Dieudonné,
is an exceedingly bright, clever and fascinating novel. It is cast in a peculiar mould,
and holds the reader as much by its weird singularity as by its ingenious plot and
striking incidents. The theme is mainly the strange adventures and experiences of
four people, three men and one woman, who, in the midst of a storm, are cast from
the Earth to a small star, which is as yet in a volcanic state and but partially cooled,
Rondah, the heroine, being left behind. There they remain for over thirty-three years,
during twenty of which, the winter season, they sleep, as is the habit of the inhabitants
of the star, who are mostly bird people with wings. These bird people are vegetables
and grow in enormous pods. The action never pauses and surprise is followed by surprise.
Love and jealousy are mingled with mystery, forming a romance of decided
interest and much power. The heroine is afterwards brought to the star and takes part
in a number of startling episodes, notably the exploration of the wonderful Sun Island.
“<span class='sc'>Rondah</span>” is one of the best of the fanciful novels now so popular.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>“Rondah; or, Thirty-three Years in a Star,” is one of the brightest,
most ingenious and most absorbing of the fanciful and mysterious class of
novels recently made so popular by H. Rider Haggard. It is much better
than “She” or “King Solomon’s Mines,” and will give greater satisfaction.
The plot is strange and weird and the incidents surprising in the
highest degree. The scene is laid chiefly in a little star with subterranean
volcanic fires and boiling seas. To this small planet, not yet entirely fitted
for human inhabitants, some of the characters are conveyed by extraordinary
means from the Earth while a tempest is in progress. Their adventures
during the luxuriant summer and the icy twenty years’ winter are
vividly and strikingly depicted, love, hate, jealousy and enthusiasm entering
largely into their very peculiar and interesting experience. The heroine,
who for a time remains on Earth, has also a strange career. She
eventually reaches the star and plays a prominent part in the disclosure
of the mysteries of the Sun Island, a wonderful region of marvels and magnificence.
The romance is by Florence Carpenter Dieudonné, and is finely
written. It will be widely read and greatly liked.</i></p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>“MONARCH OF FATE.”</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>“Monarch of Fate is man, above all destiny.
Man yet shall chain the stars;
shall drive the harnessed worlds,” said Regan
Farmington.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was winter midnight in the Adirondack
Mountains. Regan had brought us to the desolate
hut of a hermit; we had not realized that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the circumstance might be the result of design;
it seemed like an accident.</p>

<p class='c013'>We had been lost in the snow storm; the
horses had failed us; even Father Renaudin, who
for twenty years had not missed his smallest
appointment for any hindrance, was bewildered
and could not say which way to go to save us all
from death.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a spirit of the storm itself, Regan had led
us through drifted ravines and across cloudy
plains until we reached safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>The warm light of the fire fell upon a company
which had never before been united under one
roof.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was Father Renaudin, the fanatical,
puritanic priest of a small new sect, one which
he had gathered in this wilderness. His silver
hair, pale, stern face, tall, powerful form and
crimson robe were vividly illuminated. Beside
him sat the beautiful Isabella, with bronze hair,
starry eyes, perfect face; her purple velvet robes
were heavy with rich furs; her arms and hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>were sparkling with jewels. A very queen of
beauty was Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other side of the hearth was Rondah, a
dull, frightened child. Her face was tear-stained
and her lips were yet quivering from her recent
fright. Her brown eyes were too large; her red
hair was tumbling loose from its braids. Still, I
must pity her—shabby, frail, in terror, but all
alone among us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan was there. I remember him yet as he
looked then. I think I shall remember him so
beyond the grave. His dark, patrician face was
lighted with iniquitous triumph, which glowed
beneath a mask of assumed quiet as fiery coals
glow under ashes. His jet black hair clustered
in rings about his brow; his wonderful, beautiful
eyes scintillated scorn. It seemed to me that
the life of his soul was demon-bred, but chained
to certain customs of humanity, because weighted
with the accident of a human body.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan’s name was the town’s disgrace; though
so young he had no friends, accepted no truths,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>discarded all faiths. He talked of a Destiny,
which, he claimed, blundered in ruling the universe—a
creature blind and non-reasoning, of
immensity itself a part; a monstrous something
driven like the sun, but by some causeless motor,
forever.</p>

<p class='c013'>The storm raged on unabated. As I looked at
Regan, some subtle influence seemed to stand
beside me. Plain as a human friend’s, I heard
its whisper:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Duped, duped again, Roy Lee! Do you recall
that this is the thirteenth of November?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The thought chilled me—the thirteenth!</p>

<p class='c013'>I hated Regan. He had just saved my life,
but still I hated him!</p>

<p class='c013'>Why did he listen, listen? One need not listen
to hear the storm!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did the old hermit die here alone?” asked
Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>The silent form lay in another room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was here. I came at the last, almost too
late,” answered Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>As in a dream I saw that death-bed—the monomaniac
lying in darkness, watched by the angel
Fear, menaced by the monarch Death, waiting,
waiting for such a friend of all the earth!</p>

<p class='c013'>“When he had forgotten all else but his dream
and my name, he gave me this. It is the secret
of his life. Perhaps you would like to know it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Regan unrolled a large scroll. It was
yellow with age, mapped and covered with long
lines and singular hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What does it mean?” asked Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>We spread the chart upon the table to view it
better.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It contains the discovery which is the result
of the observation of three generations. A circle
of meteoric worlds and fragments is whirling on
an elongated orbit about our sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once in thirty-three and a third years it
strikes the path of the Earth. Small planets
mingled with masses of chaos are brought almost
to the tops of our mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Years ago the hermit devised a spiral car,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>which, by means of subterranean cavities, walled
with cement and filled with certain explosives of
his own combination, should be shot into the
coming meteor. All the machinery of the contrivance
is hidden and connected with a secret
clock. At the precise second when the worlds
strike right the clock will explode the torpedoes
and the car will be launched into space!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Twice has Gregg Dempster seen the small
star, or world, come close. But he mistook his
measurements, as he did not calculate for the
swerving of the ball from its true orbit as it
passed the giant planets out in space.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This time he would have been successful, but
he shared the great hope, which had become the
nerve of his life, with another man and from
the lessened tension died.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right,” said Father Renaudin. “If Gregg
Dempster had kept his secret, he had seen his
star once more. But only then to die of disappointment.
For man to migrate from star to
star is an impossibility!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Then Regan replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monarch of Fate is man, above all destiny.
Man yet shall chain the stars; shall drive the
harnessed worlds!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is simply impossible!” repeated the priest.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the darkness where lay the dead man
came a voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I will give him the morning star!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then all was voiceless save the storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The dead speak!” cried the pale Rondah,
clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella had been brave in all the danger.
Now she rose and, with the girl as her companion,
stood close to the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>That mockery of mystery, a voice from the
dead, was more terrible than anything which we
were accustomed to account for by natural laws.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rocks on which the hut stood seemed to
shake and to reverberate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The people say the hermit spent his life in
tunnelling the rocks and in watching the stars,”
said Father Renaudin. “It seems as if the tunnels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>if such there be, had made musical pipes of
themselves to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Regan crossed the room to where the
two girls stood. Something was in his face which
was terrible.</p>

<p class='c013'>I hastily drew Isabella away from him. The
other one, Rondah, looking at him, fell back
from the door and cried:</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is the day! Let us go, Regan, let us
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before I could comprehend, I saw Father Renaudin
move toward Regan, who, like a flash,
opened the door and cast into the terrible, lurid
night the girl Rondah, after which he bolted the
door and steadied himself as if for a death-struggle
with Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I heard the jar of the steps of two powerful
combatants, but everything was dark. There
were no words until Regan cried:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too late! You must all go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A window crashed open above us. It gave us
a view of a world, black with storm, ringed in by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>a halo of electric fire, dashing down at us—falling,
falling!</p>

<p class='c013'>The struggle ceased. We held our weak
human hands above our heads to ward off the
stroke of a world!</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a smothering jar!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>WHERE?</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>This was death! There really was a river
for souls to cross! I felt its cold! I heard
its roar! Its chill waves lapped on an invisible
shore! This was the darkness of the grave!
Earth had not such! Where was the phantom
boatman? He should be——</p>

<p class='c013'>Where was Isabella? Where were they all?
The dead could remember all they loved on Earth!</p>

<p class='c013'>“But then,” I thought, “could the dead soul
think in such an earthly fashion? Could dead
hands reach out in damp, hot darkness and touch
rough, jagged rocks? It seemed that spirits
followed human modes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I touched a cold, still, human face, some
one who moved and hoarsely whispered: “Rondah!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Regan, awake. We are not dead!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I shrieked the words into a gloom so incomprehensible
that I had believed it was the grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan answered in a riddle, but I thought he
had not collected his senses:</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is done! Triumph! Fate has been merciful!”
He added instantly: “Don’t move!
There are chasms and waters! Don’t you hear
the sea surging?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not think he was dead! He did not
dream of a river! The meaning of his words
startled me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is Isabella?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray God she may be dead!” I answered, as
I realized what had probably happened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is here, alive but senseless.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The voice was Father Renaudin’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>We found her. After a time she revived.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan! Regan!” (Always his name first by
everyone!) she called, in a subdued voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush! The star is chained!” answered Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Then they were both silent, both as strange to
each other as if those words had had no deep
meaning. But could I ever forget?—some secret
they kept, something so great that a change of
spheres did not affect it!</p>

<p class='c013'>And I loved her! I, Roy Lee!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin, if the cloud masses of two
worlds are propitious, you can see the Holy
Land soon, but you will never tread its paths!
Roy Lee, look in that great moon, our lost home—Earth!—and
you can locate London, where
your fortunes are still, let us hope, in the ascendant!
Take a farewell look, friends, for you will
soon be as far from all that revolving globe
contains as Heaven is removed from Earth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When day comes we shall see where we
are!” I answered, but I had no hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tis very strange! This heavy air is not on
mountain top! Where is the snow? This is a
vast body of water, which roars so loudly and
falls so heavily! I can feel these rocks, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>worn smooth, some perforated, by water!” said
Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Can you imagine how we waited for that
dawn? We scarce admitted when we knew that
the darkness was paling! What were we to see?
A foreign world? We consoled ourselves with
the thought that in all the ages such a thing was
unchronicled, and we mentally decided that it
was not for a contemptible villain like Regan
Farmington to solve the mystery of a universe!</p>

<p class='c013'>No; we concluded in our consideration that
there would be found some natural explanation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin thought some tornado might
have fallen. Time might have elapsed, which
allowed rains to melt the snow. Still, even
then——</p>

<p class='c013'>Came ever dawn so suddenly!</p>

<p class='c013'>We looked on peaked and lofty lava rocks,
upon a clay-colored sea sweeping to a near horizon.
Tall steepled, non-verdured isles broke the
surface of the sea. The air was heavy, as if we
were in a covered pit. Clouds sunk so low that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>we could almost touch them, dark brown and
green-blue clouds, inexpressibly gloomy.</p>

<p class='c013'>In silence we looked away from each other’s
faces; each waited for some one else to say the
words:</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a star!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With one bound the sun rose up. Across the
shimmering clouds flamed a bewildering gorgeousness
surpassing description. The colors of
a thousand sunsets were moving in unparalleled
radiance above our heads, covering the entire
field of heaven. Far, far were we from being
pleased to look upon this glory! Oh! dawn of
doom! Never was such a daybreak upon our
own green world!</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun rose above the banks of clouds. It
sent shafts through the breaks and silvered pinnacles
of rock. It marked white circles on the
troubled waters. Then the day became gloomy
and a storm of rain fell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella first acknowledged our situation:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“It is certainly a star! Gregg Dempster was
right!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor child, I am sorry that you are here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Regan who said this, and his words
were so softly spoken, so musical and gentle,
that I wondered (and raged) when I heard them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My life’s years and toils are wasted, my
creeds useless, my people lost, my mission vain!
What shall I preach to stones and uncooled stars?
What little good I shall do where there are only
four souls in a world!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The words were a wail of utter despair, a cry
from a broken heart. It was Father Renaudin
who uttered them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan, it was fiendish to doom others to
share this fate with you! Why have you selected
the most pious and the most beautiful for this
misery? This man’s life was a holy ambition.
A dull or ordinary man would have borne the
change better. Isabella had all earth’s pleasures
and triumphs before her; there were others who
would have lost but little.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“It takes a particularly selected company to
insure a great success!” answered Regan. “I
have selected my people with the most special
care! I could not afford to pity! If I had
allowed so maudlin a sentiment to enter my soul,
it would have been for Isabella!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He laughed triumphantly. It was a most exasperating
sound for a dupe to hear—the knell
of my hopes, for I had much to lose. My father’s
house was an honorable one, our wealth was
phenomenal in the age, our ships were on all
seas, our name known in the world’s marts. I
had all, on Earth. Here I was a useless, helpless
dupe—I, Roy Lee!</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is all too terrible to be true!” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You who claim such faith in an infinite
Jehovah are easily depressed!” sneered Regan.
“Possibly your Deity has forgotten you! I prefer
to trust to blind, blundering Destiny, that
soul of universes! She has neither lost nor
forsaken this atom of the creation, this little
star islanded in space!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Father Renaudin rose and went slowly away
into the gloomy ravines. He moved as if half a
century had been added to his years, leaning
heavily upon his staff. His face was drawn and
dreadful to look upon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Follow him!” said Isabella, hurriedly. “He
will destroy himself!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! no,” coolly replied Regan. “He is a
fanatic. He believes that something almighty
has great need of his human services. His
narrow-fenced faith will hold him fast. His
heart may break, but his soul will stand firm
through every trial. These earthly superstitions
are very comfortable possessions!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am very, very sorry for him!” whispered
Isabella, turning to me; but she listened to Regan
as if he had authority. I wondered why! What
possible regard could that wealthy, beautiful girl
of high caste have for that vagabond Regan?</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I remembered that caste was gone. We
were transferred to the Age of Stone. We could
select a cave, build a hearth of rocks, fry a fish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and sleep. Wake, fry more fish; after years
enough had passed we could die! Horrible!</p>

<p class='c013'>I rose and walked about to wake myself. It
might be all a dream. It must be all a dream!</p>

<p class='c013'>In the sunlight above the clouds I saw Father
Renaudin standing upon the summit of a peak.
His white hair was blown on the wind; it looked
like silver.</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella had not spoken one word of regret.
There was no sorrow in her eyes, no apprehension
in her manner. She was as composed as if the
inevitable had occurred.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin and I blamed Regan, and we
had expressed our blame in strong words. She
said nothing. I went to her side and said to her:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How can you be so quiet? Do you realize
your fate, your loneliness?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is worth loneliness to be the only woman
in a world!” she replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cold, hopeless acceptance of her tone
shocked me immeasurably. Another thought!
True, a world was in our possession!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The sun had passed the noon mark when
Father Renaudin came down the hills. A wonderful
peace was on his face; a strange delight
was in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Earth has not all she needs. We can learn
faster here!” he replied to our wondering comments.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He thinks he has seen another vision, I
believe!” whispered Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; he thinks nothing! Father Renaudin is
of the mould of that humanity which does see
visions if ever they are seen!” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then we saw the great world rise up—a
fiery globe, where dimly emerald and palely blue
were lands and seas. The continents turned before
our eyes. The light of this giant moon
made it still day for us, though our sun had set.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh! grand, great world! I cast myself upon
the rocks in agony that it was lost, <i>lost</i>! Something
was whispering in my ear:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Duped, duped, duped again, Roy Lee!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My son,” and Father Renaudin laid his hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>gently upon my shoulder, “do not let sorrow
overcome you. It is nothing. Only a human
life lost. A sort of death has come. It is a kind
death—removal from temptation, from necessity
to sin; a respite for glorious work; the chance
for a higher place in eternity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A world unfinished; seas simmering over
primeval fires. A baby world, devoid of great
opportunity. It is as Regan says. God, if God
there be, has forgotten us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so, not so! Being here, God’s work for
us is here. Shall we not do it? Rise up!
Shake off your grief, apply your wonderful
ability, your great practical knowledge, to the
improvement of the sphere!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His voice was as a song of triumph, a chant of
victory!</p>

<p class='c013'>As I rose to my feet, Regan sprung lightly
past me. He took his stand upon a huge square
rock; from his cloak he drew a large silken
banner wrought with a showy design in red and
gold. He shook its folds to the wind.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“I claim this world, with all its contents, by
right of discovery! It is my just possession!
Its sovereign am I! Its seas are my ways, its
lands my domains, its people my subjects!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Turning to Father Renaudin, Regan held toward
him a shining band of silver, set with gems.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, Father Renaudin, put this on my brow!
You are the highest religious dignitary of the
world in which I am!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so!” cried I. “No man’s subject am I!
The people rule! Father Renaudin, you will
not found a monarchy where no such absurd
abomination has ever existed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have not the worlds themselves one sun
supreme for ruler? Find in the universe one
whirling,  stupendous  monarchy! Where is the
denunciation in Holy Writ against a good king?
God himself upholds thrones!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This man is a scoundrel, a fiendish monster!
See how he toys with lives and souls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think, with his superhuman strength and
intelligence, how brilliant shall he stand; as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>archangel at that last day, when, his work done,
he shall bring in his nations and their glory!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin passed me by, and, in another
moment, stood beside Regan. He placed the
crown upon his brow. His flag fell like a radiant
robe about him. His triumphant eyes were
magnificent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Close beside the rock where he stood was
Isabella, gazing steadfastly. Her look was almost
devotional. My heart beat slower when I
beheld her. Everything seemed falling. I realized
with all the rest, “Duped, duped, duped!”
Regan a king—I standing mute, a subject, listening
to the first prayer upon the star for blessings
on his head—this man whose friendship I had
despised, this vagabond whom I had at times
patronized!</p>

<p class='c013'>Dizzily I looked at him. I saw about him,
over his lava throne, around his regal cloak,
hovering a yellow, mysterious light, a visible,
tremulous, bewildering baptism of his awful destiny,
surrounding him as does the zodiac the sun!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>I knew I could not stop his rise! I knew there
was a greater power than that of man which cut
his pathway!</p>

<p class='c013'>My path was dark. Isabella looked away. I
could not see her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Duped, duped!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I fell senseless to the ground.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>A MONSTER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>When next I realized events, the life of the
Stone Age had begun. We dwelt in a cave;
a fire of drift wood was burning; a bird was frying.
My head was pillowed on coarse grass, and
one of Isabella’s purple wraps covered me. It
was night, and rain was falling.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had hoped for my return to health for
many days. They told me that they had learned
much concerning the little star. It was about
three hundred miles in circumference. The lofty
peaks were disproportioned to the size, according
to all our standards of measurement; they served
as observatories for overlooking the surface of
one-half the sphere. The ball seemed belted by
a continuous continent, with deeply indented
shores; this made a very long coast line.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“There are fine harbors and very good locations
for great towns,” said Isabella to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Towns! One person in a town! My brain was
still dull from my illness. As a worrying remembrance,
I thought of ships, people, tumult of business.
Then I looked away at the great star
which was our Earth. Home was there. All was
there. This was a wilderness of uncooled lava!</p>

<p class='c013'>“He must be told of our discovery,” cheeringly
remarked Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thereupon he brought and arranged upon a
large flat stone a little circle of smoke-blackened
stones, surrounding some charred sticks, and a
couple of bones.</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked at this collection and then wonderingly
at their triumphant faces, astonished at
their waiting, expectant manner. What did they
mean me to see in that little circle?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin found it on the top of the
mountain,” explained Isabella, joyfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I appoint you to commence, continue and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>control manufactures and all the commerce of
the star,” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still I did not see. I had been very ill. I
had not, as yet, become accustomed to the
chances of the planet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Roy,” said Isabella, “some man built this circle!
Don’t you know that neither beasts nor
birds could build a hearth and light a fire?”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was it! In the childish toy before me
was the promise of a world! There was commerce,
manufactures, wealth, hope, life—the old
life! What did I care that Regan was monarch!
The wealth would be the real power! That
would be mine again, all mine! I should rule
the sea, I, Roy Lee!</p>

<p class='c013'>I had been weak, but I was strong now; my
lethargy was gone. There was work to be done
at once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the course of the star was toward the sun,
the heat was becoming intense, and we removed
from our station in the black ravine to the edge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of the forest, where it was more pleasant, and
near the sea, where it was cooler.</p>

<p class='c013'>We traveled, in moving, over the roughest
way, crossing mountains and going around deep
arms of the sea. The air was much more dense
than that which we had been accustomed to
breathe. It seemed as if we were inhaling warm
water. As we ascended into the heights we
found it more comfortable, except when we
struck one of the chilly clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The small ball with its little gravitation caused
us to be so light that we were not fatigued,
and as the days were only six hours long we had
but a short time to labor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having found a site which was remarkably
pleasant, we built ourselves four stone houses,
and proceeded to adorn the grounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>We called the broad, rapid river which flowed
past to the sea the Styx, because its waters were
so dark and because the forest on the further
side was so mysterious.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tall trees about us were of corn stalk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>consistency. They grew from a deep morass.
The broad leaves formed so close a surface that
they penned the heated air beneath them, and
at noon-time we could see the atmosphere turn
to a greenish hue, and vibrate as if over a heated
stove.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes the roots became too heavy and,
falling somewhere, pulled the tops to the ground.
Sometimes the tops became too heavy and the
tree toppled on one side, lodged, and, after
awhile, fell with some of its fellows into a pile of
green reeds and vines. These heaps of trunks and
webs of vines made it possible for us to cross the
river; from isle to isle there were vine bridges
formed, and thus we were enabled to investigate
the forest, where we were glad to find an abundance
of fruit and berries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Into this bewildering maze, a dreamland of
bottomless swamps and foundationless jungle,
Regan and I went often. Always in the morning,
as at noon its heat became unendurable. We
found many birds, which we killed with no difficulty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>several different fruits, and a few harmless
serpents. There was a lack of animal life in the
seething woodlands of the Star.</p>

<p class='c013'>We gathered a bark, softer and lighter than
that of the birch, and this we used for paper,
upon which we chronicled every important event,
fact and discovery of our Earth, as fast as we
could remember them. We were making wooden
type and printing presses, but meantime wrote
everything so as not to forget; forget and grow
like the uncivilized nations of Earth before we
could find those people who had built the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were late this day. The burdens of bark
were heavy and hindered our progress through
the vines and over the fallen trunks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hours, always too few, had gone before we
knew it, and we were hastening to get into the
cooler air, in momentary expectation of falling
from the heat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where does this intense heat come from?”
asked Regan. “Is it all from the sun?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Star itself is not cooled,” replied I. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>imagine, if the heat were from the sun wholly,
the seas would boil over their entire surface
rather than in spots.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tis a Planet in construction, not nearly finished,”
said Regan. “Now what possible reason
can there be for such a thing as that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He pointed to a great black surface of lava,
which rose in a mud lake or very deep slough.
Around were trees veiled in vines, a reed-grown
width of swamp and a waste of reddish mud.</p>

<p class='c013'>I noticed that the great reeds were matted like
crushed cornstalks in many places; they were
also mud-spattered and generally draggled and
disturbed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was necessary for us to spring from one of
the matted foot-holds to the ball of lava and from
there reach the overhanging vines on the other
side; unless we did this we must make a long,
uncertain tour around the steaming slough into
the vibrating heat of the forest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shall we cross, or go around?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us cross, leaving our burdens of bark in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>this tree; we will return for them to-morrow,”
said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>We swung them into the low bough and sprang
upon the block, wondering again that it should
be there, in the bottomless morass.</p>

<p class='c013'>It began to move! It shook, commenced to sink!
From the mud rose a pillar of black flesh, surmounted
by a hideous, yellow-eyed, serpent-tongued
head.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a powerful stroke the shape reached after
us, and, striking Regan, cast him like a ball into
the vines of the bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, with the sinking bulk, I was slipping,
sliding into the muddy depths, clutching at the
shell and shrieking at the trees. I fell under the
shade of a huge paw, with fingers like those on
the human hand, but at least four feet in length.
As I sank into the iron-like mire, that hand fell,
splashing and clawing, after me in a surge of
mud. I rolled between two fingers, over the paw
again uplifted, and into a mass of crushed reeds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dashing the mud from my face, I saw Regan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>spring upon the huge back, now heaving and
moving like a small mountain; dodging the head,
he sprang into the morass beside me; missing
the reeds, he sunk into the mud to his shoulders,
but, clutching some vines and reeds as he fell, he
drew himself partly up, and reaching a log stood
upon it.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stretched out his hand to me and I clambered
to where he stood; together we climbed
up the bank, not pausing for even a moment’s
rest. The sun burned down; the morass was
steaming in white vapor, but the monster began
to loosen its bulk from the slough bed and, partially
turned, came toward us, swaying its hideous
head, its tongue darting not far from us. It
clawed the banks, but they fell under its feet,
and it splashed into the slough. Recovering its
lost ground, it clumsily climbed on. Trees
crushed down like the grass as it moved. I
could not breathe in the heat; even with that
creature coming I did not think I could flee.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Leave me, leave me! Escape? I cannot
move!” I gasped to Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Man, have you nothing to live for?” cried
Regan, with a look of rage in his face which even
then I noticed. “It is a terrible death! Rouse
up! There is the river! Run, Roy, run!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I saw the blue water. I thought I might as
well try. We ran a few steps and came where a
bridge of vines, falling to the surface of the river,
gave us the salvation of a little island.</p>

<p class='c013'>We swung across and sank down in some shade
to dash water on our hot faces and hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we glanced back. There came the awful
shape, blindly and madly following us. We could
see it plainly—a head like that of a hippopotamus
on a huge trunk which looked like a tree
bole, a great flattened body like a turtle’s, a black
shell which we had thought lava, long paws ending,
as I had before observed, in human-shaped
hands. Devoid of instinct, although in bulk as
large as twenty full-grown elephants and in
strength proportioned, it did not stop when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>clawed vines instead of earth, but pushed itself
over the river’s edge of lava rocks and fell headlong,
helpless, into the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it can swim, we are lost!” I said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, or if the water is shallow it will crawl
out!” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Swing back on the vines; a few farther up
are left!” shouted I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is gone!” said Regan. “Look!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a mighty surge of the waves, a few
tremendous tossings; then the water settled
silently, and whatever became of the monster in
the depths below we saw it no more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like lead or like a leaf, all is the same in
those swallowing waters!” said we, as we wearily
sought a path home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I could but think how brave he was, that
Regan, to return from comparative safety upon
the very block of his danger to drag from death
one who claimed not even to be his friend!</p>

<p class='c013'>I could not understand why so persistently
Regan always befriended me to the utmost of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>power when our natural hate was unconcealed
from each other! I was forced to admire his
courage. I could not comprehend why he should
take so much unnecessary and thankless trouble,
for I almost wished that I had died rather than
that he had saved me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having learned the signs of the lairs of these
beasts, we avoided them in our future visits.
They were somnolent creatures and never woke
but under provocation. With greater precautions
we continued our investigations in the forests,
for we must know the resources and productions
of our world.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a long, long winter before us, far
off, but inevitable.</p>

<p class='c013'>We made collections of large plantain-shaped
leaves, which we used for building triple platforms
to serve for shades above the roofs of our
houses.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>A LIVING ISLAND.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Shortly the vines and flowers veiled our
walls and hid us in temples of green, crimson
and white-hued blossoms. A paradise was
about us.</p>

<p class='c013'>We turned water from the mountain springs
and made silvery lakes and rippling streams
through the shaded fragrance. We almost forgot
that Gregg Dempster had predicted a twenty
years winter!</p>

<p class='c013'>There were trees with silver fringes, others
with crimson leaves, and masses of shrubs whose
leaves were the purple velvet of the pansy. The
landscape became like a beautiful dream; its
coloring was of a kind which paled the hues of
Earth to insipidity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nature seemed to move by contraries; everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>was a bewilderment. We were afraid the
very trees would encroach upon us and wind us
in their ever-extending arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>The waters of the heavy, frothy sea scintillated
with the brilliant hues of the rainbow, but
not a leaf or a twig would float upon them; everything
sank, even the feathers with which we
experimented.</p>

<p class='c013'>The low-hanging clouds had fantastic shapes
and were constantly casting wonderful prismatic
effects upon sea and rock. The shafts of light
which broke through them made the star kaleidoscopic;
but during storms we seemed to be in
the volume of the bursting thunder-clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Verdure began to bloom on those distant isles
out at sea. I had given up hope of reaching
them, but Regan ever looked restlessly away at
those singular islands, those lonely peaks and
mounds in that steaming, unbounded water.
Through noon’s heat, through starlit nights, he
watched and considered how to reach them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“To be king of the isles and unable to get to
the isles!” he explained to Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try a balloon!” suggested Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have thought of that,” said Regan. “We
have no cloth, or the possibility of manufacturing
any. Then the laws of atmospheric pressure, the
lack of gravitation, the too hot air above volcanoes,
or some other reason on this little ball, may
cause the work of months to be a failure. I cannot
afford to fail!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not there, certainly; failure means death in
the sea!” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose so,” reluctantly assented Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If by any means we could attach a rope to
that central peak of rock!” said Isabella. She
was always so intensely interested in anything
that Regan wished to do!</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few minutes Regan sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Isabella, I have thought how I can get
there!” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?” we asked in a breath.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With ropes and kites!” he replied.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Then for weeks we busied ourselves in making
heavy vine cables and strong, light cords. We
made, also, with the utmost pains to have them
exactly alike, two huge bark kites.</p>

<p class='c013'>How like child’s play it seemed, I thought, as
with diligence, day after day, we devoted our
whole time to this petty work.</p>

<p class='c013'>But why not play? What better were we
than children in this land where we looked vainly
for any sign of the existence of those people who
had lighted the fire on the circle of stones?</p>

<p class='c013'>I wondered if Regan had not kindled that fire to
make us believe that he was king of something!
No; I could not think so. I would have been
glad to doubt him, but I could not. One who
lived daily where he was must believe in him
whether he would or not.</p>

<p class='c013'>All was prepared. The heavy cables wound
the huge basket, strung to slide on them. The
light cords were attached to the kites, the heavy
ones to fly them were ready. When a strong
wind blew directly toward the isle we started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>them. The idea was to sail them above and
beyond the peak. Thus they would carry the
unbroken cord around the lava column; by cutting
the kite strings the kites would fall, dropping
the cord where we could draw it so as to
bring, instead of its lightness, the great vine
cables about the peak, and then we could cross
with the basket. Having once drawn ourselves
to the isle we could make a permanent basket
ferry.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the cables broke, even if the little cord
tangled, our work must be done over again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As if to please the king,” Isabella said, the
night breeze, strong and straight, blew to the isle.</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked at that vine-veiled bunch of chaotic,
volcanic collection; almost it seemed like some
primeval mammoth of the lost ages. How mysterious
a common thing becomes when we are
hindered from reaching it! But for that fathomless,
seething sea we had never desired to go to
that particular point.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something like horror was in my heart as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>stood gazing at the flights of the kites. Father
Renaudin and Isabella were to remain on shore.
There were so few of us if anything should
happen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The kites flew in a gray evening twilight. A
black storm slept on the near horizon; around us
all things were darkening. How beautiful they
were—the kites! Then I stopped my thoughts
angrily. Had I, for lack of greater things to
watch, reached a stage where I was interested in
the flight of a kite, I who had managed great
white-sailed fleets of Earth, I who had selected
their silken wares, sold their immense cargoes, I,
Roy Lee?</p>

<p class='c013'>I could not shake it off—the feeling that it
was of the vastest importance that the kites sail
right.</p>

<p class='c013'>They did sail right. “As if an angel guided
them,” Father Renaudin said. I hoped Isabella
would not say anything about their sailing to
please the king, and she did not; she only
breathlessly watched them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>It was a perfect success. Regan’s work again.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the close of the following day the basket
swung on the cables stretching from shore to the
island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early the next morning we crossed to the
island, which looked strange and more dangerous
as we neared. We stood upon the shore and
from the basket took the shovels, cords, hatchets
and spears which we always carried now. There
was a roll of blankets of straw cloth, which we
had also brought to serve as shelter from heat.</p>

<p class='c013'>We took each a couple, slung on our shoulders;
took long, strong staves in our hands and climbed
up the gashed sides of the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wondering more and more at every step at
this strange rock, at the singular terror which we
could but control with strong determination, we
both felt like rushing even into the waters of
the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the high cliffs we gazed into a round,
deep cavity, half-dark even at noon with a haze
of settling smoke.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“It looks like the throat of a beast,” said
Regan, as we hesitated on the brink.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking closely, we saw a volcanic crater such
as was common all over the continent. It was
only faintly alive. The smoke was reddish above
the crater’s mouth. Listening, like a giant’s
breath we could hear the roar of the surging
flames far below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What can be those two huge yellow spots in
that vale?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They look like two great plates of gold,”
answered Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like little mirrors laid on the rock,” said I.
“Shall we go down?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, I came for that,” responded Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>We began the descent. Once I paused. There
was the tremor of a slight earthquake. The volcano’s
breath was heavier. Under the clouds of
smoke we were shaded. Cautiously we stepped
from stone to stone, so much terrified that
neither of us spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are these plates?” at last said I.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>They were about twelve feet in diameter, of
a round, yellow and wrinkled substance, but
whether vegetable, mineral or animal we could
not determine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without a word of his intention, Regan
raised his hammer of stone and struck a powerful
blow upon the yellow surface by which we
were standing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The earth shuddered, the cliffs burst and cracked;
the island itself leaped from the sea, and
about our heads tumbled stone and pillars of
rock, dust of lava, deluges of vines. An awful
call of rage, a voice from the rocks, the menacing
roar from the living soil sounded like the
trump of doom about us. Everywhere, from all
the walls of stone at once, not like thunder and
not like sea—more like the bellow of the most
mighty convulsion of earthquake which humanity
ever knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>Trees fell; vines entangled us. We would
have fled, but there was no place to flee. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>land was raging. That voice—that maddening,
horrible voice!</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s an eye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a demon orb, great, horrifying, fusing,
flashing, that eye looked at us. Those wrinkled
yellow covers were the lids.</p>

<p class='c013'>The breath was a snort of vengeance now. It
was a living island! Those eyes—those awful
eyes!</p>

<p class='c013'>I shrank from their glare. I fell into the
crater’s mouth. An instant I swung above a
fiery depth. Regan caught my hand with mighty
strength. I saw his face, defiant even then, looking
up at those toppling peaks and quivering,
gashed sides.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has only to let go. I shall be out of his
way forever then!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in the supreme suspense of the moment
I thought I could not die and leave Isabella more
happy without me.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was going to save me. I knew he would.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the rocks moved from him and together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>we rolled into the fiery crater, among sulphur
and hot stones. We clung to the sides, the voice
bewildering us with its roar, the breath shaking
the whole surface of the volcano and of the rock.
The smoke rose into a pillar above the crater.
The yellow glare of the fire showed us where we
were, showed us the danger on all sides.</p>

<p class='c013'>So strange an enemy stilled our hearts and
palsied our faculties. We did nothing. Entombed
in a volcano, hopelessly we sank upon the
sand and waited, waited for death, until the daylight
had gone. It was night.</p>

<p class='c013'>By this time the voice was still; the angry
island had ceased to groan. The yellow liquid
fire seethed in the cauldron; the smothering
flames and smoke were often puffed into our
faces.</p>

<p class='c013'>What would it do? A mad isle had its human
hate! Was all the Star alive? Had the ball a
huge heart to beat in the fiery centre? Had
rocks a brain and nerve to think?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you believe it possible for rock and
flame to look and think?” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>I spoke to hear my own voice. The silence of
voices was as bad as the danger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are not surprised to see that a sponge is
vegetable in fibre with animal life,” replied
Regan. “Roy, this is yellow gold; see here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan shook some cooled drops of the liquid
of the volcano into my hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it on the ashes. Gold or dross it is all
the same here. Let us cast ourselves down into
this pit and end it all!” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>I could die well enough if Regan would die
too!</p>

<p class='c013'>Our blankets had fallen with us. Regan
spread one above the flame. The hot air began
to fill it. There was a hope. At once we were
more cheerful. We broidered the ends of the
blankets together, tied them into a balloon shape,
expanding the mouths with our broken staves,
leaving loops for our hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>We held the bag inverted above the crater.
It slowly inflated. It began to pull.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That weak thing to swing above that lava!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Never!” I exclaimed, and thoughtlessly, tortured
by the heat, I let go the staves.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a second’s time Regan was swung into the
air; the smoke hid him; he did not return.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I gave way to my bitter despair and
wept as I cast myself on the stones. Forever he
was gone! I was alone—entombed by the rage
of an island, deserted by the hate of a man!</p>

<p class='c013'>How long it was I do not know. Day whitened
the crater smoke. I heard a voice call: “Roy!
Roy!” It sounded in the rocks at my side:
“Roy! Roy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, at the right!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A torch flared. There he was, with water and
food; he had found another opening into the
crater. After I had drunk the water and eaten
the food we returned into the sunlight to life
once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking about us at the strange rocks, we
wondered at our unseeing blindness when we had
walked on that half-animal surface of wrinkled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>unnatural stone and had not thought it a mighty
leviathan of unknown existence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still the cables were unbroken. We returned
over the homeward way, a little apprehensive
that the isle could remember as well as groan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once more we stood beside the waiting two,
Father Renaudin and Isabella. They had seen.
The island had half-reared from the sea. Its contour
was changed; its rocks were broken. They
had seen its peaks topple, had noted its awful
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a time we feared the very soil on which
we walked, but we discovered no signs of life in
the continental cliffs.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this we made no more investigations for
some time, while the line of white at the far
north became less and less. The mass of black
and fire-streaked cloud at the south grew larger
and redder.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun began to burn the whole day, instead
of at noon only. When it rose it seemed as if a
great furnace door opened on us. We stayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>in the shelter of our vines and beside our lake
of water.</p>

<p class='c013'>One night we were sitting before our houses,
watching the shimmer of the river where the
firelight fell upon it. We heard the sound of
wings; looking up at the moonless sky we saw
floating black forms—huge birds, we thought.
We saw their wings reflecting the light as they
moved, saw their eyes shining like glass, saw
faces looking wistfully down upon us!</p>

<p class='c013'>What were those things, circling nearer, lower,
slower?</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is the people at last! Thank God!” cried
Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is the people!” hissed Regan. “Monsters
with wings!” Then I heard him whisper:
“But if there were a God he would do this!
He would not people every world the same!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I was glad that his subjects had wings, those
great, strong wings! Magnificent attributes!</p>

<p class='c013'>They came down and stood beside us, their
wings hanging like folded cloaks, mottled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>splotched with red, orange and silver. They
looked like ambassadors in ’broidered mantles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If we could speak to them!” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can understand all that you say!” they
answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was useless to try to find out where and of
whom they had learned our language. They
only could tell us that they had been taught
from the Sun Island, a far-off land of the sea.
Sometimes, they said, the tide was low and we
could walk on dry rocks to the isle. Sometimes
there was a “wall in the air.” Then no one
could get there.</p>

<p class='c013'>Who is there? What is there? There was
no answer. We could think of no way of
accounting for this; we determined to visit the
place at once, but other cares prevented us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another strange thing occurred.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>BLOSSOMS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>When daylight came our friends were still
in existence and gathered about our houses.
I had feared that they would vanish as a dream
of night.</p>

<p class='c013'>They led us to a vale, hidden between perpendicular
walls of rock. Miles and miles the cleft
extended, and the surface of the lowland was
filled with a strange-looking growth. Tall pods,
smooth and satiny, in color pale green, stood like
soldiers in an army. The pods were as much as
ten feet in height and shaped like the husks of
an ear of corn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Walking among these pods we heard confused
murmurs and calls, as if the green things themselves
had voices.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we came upon one of the pods burst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>open; from the husk crawled forth a winged
man, blind and helpless, his huge wings useless
and cumbersome.</p>

<p class='c013'>I saw the truth. These people were a living
vegetable—a product of the soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>After we had somewhat recovered from our
consternation, we began to consult. It was blossoming
time; we must harvest our people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thousands of subjects for Regan; thousands
of artisans for me! Sailors for air-ships, toilers
at looms! A host of people for Father Renaudin
to preach to and to teach. A crowd to fill a vast
cathedral. A populace!</p>

<p class='c013'>We remained among them for some weeks,
until they were strong enough to fly away over
wood and mountain isle. We taught them our
language, engrafted our ideas upon them and
instilled our desires into the minds and hearts of
this new multitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were earnest, politic workers; for once
every one of us joined in the one great purpose—to
civilize the people that we need not live in
a world alone!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Our success was unlimited. There seemed to
be no barriers to their understanding; they comprehended,
became interested; in a few weeks
they helped us plan. We had a great army of
docile, winged servants.</p>

<p class='c013'>There appeared to exist no envy, hate or
anger among them. They were ambitious, but
they were not treacherous. Their faith in us, in
all we hoped and in all we did, was perfect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan was delighted. He planned the most
stupendous works.</p>

<p class='c013'>We took possession of four great plains bordering
on the sea, and each, with those who chose
to assist, began improvements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will build a cathedral which shall surpass
St. Peter’s!” said Father Renaudin. “I shall
have a praise-offering congregation, for I can see
no sin among these bird men! They are not a
fallen race; their brain is not clogged by wickedness!
That is why they learn so fast!”</p>

<p class='c013'>We knew another thing, but we thought
Father Renaudin did not see it, so we did not tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>him. It was that this people, with all their
brilliance of intellect, lacked something. They
would never be a dominant race. They must
have leaders, and I am compelled to acknowledge
that in Regan they had found one. What a
commander of hosts he would have been, had
there been any occasion for the hosts! What a
defender of the nations, had there only been
need of a defence!</p>

<p class='c013'>We even began to dislike our security!</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was, Regan built walls and piers, planted
great gardens to decorate his mountain sides,
erected towns and surrounded them with terraces
of earth and stone work, where the silver of
fountains was contrasted with pale thread-like
leaves, purple pansy color and deep cardinal red.
The spires and domes and squares which he
designed were always architecturally superior to
any which the rest of us could conceive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella had a pretty little town. Every house
seemed a home-like cottage of Earth. She had
schools and soon printing presses, upon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Father Renaudin printed condensed remembrances
of the most important subjects of earthly
teachings. Isabella herself put into record music
and poetry, “original and selected.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We found among the volcano’s rocky depths
many beds of sulphur. We found also many
minerals of Earth. Of iron, lead, silver and salt
we had mines and worked them.</p>

<p class='c013'>A heavy reed, growing in abundance, was
easily pasted and pressed into sheets of paper.
Among the grasses we found one rice-like seed
which gave us a substance which, when crushed,
made a not unwholesome floury food. We found
some roots which were palatable when baked.
We had varied and delicious fruits.</p>

<p class='c013'>We made cloth from straw and from bark, and
from a cotton-like growth we manufactured a
fine, soft, gauze-like material, very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along the mountain’s side was a flattened
rock platform, upon which we built great rough-walled
manufactories, and the smoke looked very
earthly as it rose from the pipes and chimneys.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Of laborers we had a limitless supply, each
hand as interested in our experiments as were
we ourselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of demand for our wares we had almost too
much, for the whole Star wished to possess each
article of convenience, dress or luxury. In a
singularly perfect copy of Earth the furnishings
and decorations of the rooms of the palaces of
piled-up, smoothed stone thickened in the vales.</p>

<p class='c013'>We taught these men the use of pen and ink;
taught them correspondence, postal service and
the value of the clinking silver coins.</p>

<p class='c013'>We brought the study of music into light and
they constructed, after our models, harps, cymbals,
trumpets, guitars and drums. Anthems
and chorals for the Cathedral service were chanted
in the halls. Light and graceful melodies of
Earth were trilled from the hills.</p>

<p class='c013'>Art was represented by colossal statuary in
glass, stone and lava, in painting and in metal
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oils and crude colors for painting were collected,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the first from slain animals, the second from
earths, crushed berries and ground minerals.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a busy, bustling little star, whirling in
a furnace heat toward the sun. The only comfortable
hours upon it were in the night when
Venus was ablaze before us.</p>

<p class='c013'>The years went by so fast! The clouds sank
closer to the surface of the star. We began to
be almost smothered in their noonday weight!</p>

<p class='c013'>The growth of the verdure of the star had
changed it from a black lava ball to one mass of
green and gorgeousness. The tops of the peaks
alone stood above the vines.</p>

<p class='c013'>The trees were lost in their own green; moss
clung to everything. The steaming sea, always
boiling in spots above the lava of subterranean
chasms and volcanoes, further moistened the
noonday air, which, if it had been of Earth, had
been utterly unendurable in its temperature.</p>

<p class='c013'>We understood that the clouds cloaked our
planet. The dense air was not like the world’s
atmosphere. We were close to the orbit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Venus; we feared that we should go on and burn
in the flames of the sun!</p>

<p class='c013'>We appointed a day to gather with our chief
friends that we might report our achievements
and our successes.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were to meet at the town built by Father
Renaudin, where we arranged for a grand festival
to take place in his cathedral, now nearly completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a long day’s travel, I arrived, weary and
dusty. Isabella and Father Renaudin came out
to meet me. It was sunset; the last beam of
sunlight had just left the scene. It was a still,
sultry, purplish twilight.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we walked beneath an avenue of bloom, we
heard the most enchanting music.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stepping through the bowers of green, we
looked up into the sky. Above the surface, so
far as to be still in the glow of the sun, which
was below the horizon, we saw a multitude of
white-robed people.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“Is it a stampede of angels?” asked Father
Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their floating white robes and shining, flying
hair were outlined on the blue sky. They were
illuminated by a flood of golden sunshine. They
were carrying something. We could hear their
melodious song like the sound of a far-off bell.
We could see wreaths of flowers, a mica-bright
surface. The latter was a glistening car; therein,
most gorgeous in apparel, like an Indian
prince for brilliance of attire, was Regan, crowned
and sceptered! He was followed at a distance,
we now saw, by troops of his bird men.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a true misery to me. Whatever this
villainous Regan did was always done with so
much majesty that there was no use in trying to
think it was ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He really is a monarch! It does not help me
that he has made himself one!” I thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>I raged at my own stupidity. There were my
people; they would have borne me and have
sung for me; they would have wrought fabrics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and wreaths for me, but I came on foot;
I arrived dusty and tired.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Regan first again!</p>

<p class='c013'>We enjoyed our festival; that is, I suppose
the rest did. We had torches by thousands at
the feast, had music from sea shells, reeds and
stringed instruments. We seemed to be in a
magic land, the air was so soft, the star Venus so
brilliant! The scene was bewildering! The
sea was musical!</p>

<p class='c013'>“The star is small, but it is all ours!” we said.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were no warlike races to conquer, no
insubordinate people to subdue. There was
nothing to hinder the grand march of progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>I noticed that Isabella looked pale and very
sad. I had never seen such an expression upon
her face before.</p>

<p class='c013'>The walls of the house, where we went after
the fête was over, were glittering with glass set
in panels. The doors were hung with fabrics of
gold-colored straw and of brilliant cloth. The
floors were of polished woods, overlaid with grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>rugs. Flowers were banked in corners, and a
fire was upon the hearth, for we could not pass
the hours of night without great fires, on account
of the exceeding dampness of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>When we had quietly settled ourselves for the
few hours left till day, the rain began to fall
heavily.</p>

<p class='c013'>While Father Renaudin and Regan were at
the table before the door, looking over maps, I
sat beside Isabella and we were speaking of the
change which we had made in the star.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If these people could not fly, they would
work slower. They are living machines; don’t
you think so?” said Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly their wings are a great advantage,”
replied I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know what Regan has done about
the wings?” asked Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he has not told you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He calls them ‘hideous deformities,’ ‘cumbersome
appendages.’”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Yes; I know he doesn’t like the powerful
wings of the people. But what is it, Isabella?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He says they are only subject when they
choose to be—temporarily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Isabella, have you seen Regan often
in all these years?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! yes, very often!” answered she, paying
no heed to me or my question, absorbed, as ever,
with some idea about Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Duped, duped!”—that hammer-like voice in
my ears again!</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am so troubled, Roy; he has cut off their
wings from ten—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, he thought they would recover; but
they—they—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Died?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No! I wish they had! They languished
awhile, and then they fell upon the ground only
to look more and more miserable! Finally, to
end their misery, he—”</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella began to weep bitterly.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“How in the world did you learn all this?” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was there!” she answered, composedly as
regarded my question, only in tears over Regan’s
iniquity. “Well, Roy, he killed them! They
are vegetables you know!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan a murderer!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She heard the triumph and pleasure in my
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is a king!” she began, vehemently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! He is a criminal! He ought to
be hanged!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not for subjects, not by subjects!” I had
never seen Isabella so beautiful; she looked like
an enraged goddess. “He is a king! He has a
right to kill!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you so forget right—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is ‘right’ of another world! It has no
place here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Calling men vegetables does not change the
crime!” insisted I. “These creatures have
souls! They are the humanity of the sphere!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“I shall tell you nothing more, Roy!” said
Isabella. “You do not comfort me in my
troubles! You only make me feel worse!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She turned to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stay here, stay here!” I exclaimed. “It
has been years since I have heard your voice till
now! Stay here and talk with me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And she stopped, dried her tears and did not
go away from my side until the party broke up
for the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were some good things about the star
after all. One need not follow all the hypocrisies
of Earth. If Isabella wished to remain
and talk with me, she could do so!</p>

<p class='c013'>When I was alone in my apartments, listening
to the heavy rain, I thought it all over. It was
a murderer who wore the silver crown, the ’broidered
robes, who was so kingly in his manner!
A murderer was ruler of the star! Must I be
one of his minions, I, Roy Lee?</p>

<p class='c013'>He was our law. Why not kill ten men?
Now and then in some such disagreeable way he
made us all realize his power.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>I was madly in love with Isabella, but, if I
should marry her, Regan would possibly kill
her!</p>

<p class='c013'>What would Father Renaudin think now of
the monster whom he had crowned? He ought
to take the crown from his head and give it to
me! I was the more worthy. No blood stained
my hands; my station, education and character
were suited to the position. That name, or title,
of king seemed very powerful with Isabella!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was no use to gnash my teeth and roll on
my bed. I dashed the long curtain away for air
and thought the matter over. It was Regan
who made the laws. If I spoke of a republic, he
laughed at me and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The discovery to the discoverer! A king is
a fundamental law of the creation! The stars
cannot whirl without a ruler!”</p>

<p class='c013'>If I wanted Regan dethroned, what of that?
How was I to remedy the matter?</p>

<p class='c013'>How wonderfully the rain was falling! Was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that the river roaring? The tumult was so
ceaseless and singular that I rose and dressed.
Scarcely had I done so when the sound of shrieks
and bird voices came to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hastening into the long hall where we had
been in the evening, I saw the floor covered
with water. Just then Isabella, Regan and
Father Renaudin came into the same room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is the sea! it is the sea!” they cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>We ran out upon the foot-hills, from where
we could see, in the light of the dawn, a waste of
muddy water and a shroud of cloud.</p>

<p class='c013'>We climbed into the peaks of the lava rocks
and waited, drenched with storms.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were above some of the clouds and could
only dimly see the demolition of all we prized.
Tower after tower fell. The water washed the
stones from the foundations of the cathedral.</p>

<p class='c013'>We saw the morass broken by the sea, saw
masses of land as large as a farm sink from sight
like lead.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>When we could see so far we could note the
flowing columns of fire in the cloud-dark south
still increasing in size and redness.</p>

<p class='c013'>We could hear the bursting of rocks in chasms
where the water would not stay.</p>

<p class='c013'>We found some sheltering ledges and waited.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>WINTER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>We had it all to repeat after we had endured
the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c013'>We thought that the star, having reached the
end of its elongated orbit, turned with exceeding
suddenness upon its course, so changing the temperature
of north and south as to produce the
excessive storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>I will not tell you of our discouraged hearts,
but will go on to that winter which was
approaching from this time.</p>

<p class='c013'>True that we were disheartened, but that we
should desist from our labor was impossible. We
must prepare for a frigid zone.</p>

<p class='c013'>This time we selected a high tableland, broken
through with narrow clefts where the sea penetrated
the land. Some of these clefts we roofed
over.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>We built with reference to enormous weights
of snow. We made coverings and corridors; we
put windows and pipes and tubes all so that we
could breathe and so that we could close them in
case of necessity.</p>

<p class='c013'>We sunk wells, collected oil and firewood.</p>

<p class='c013'>At one spot in the rocks we found intense
heat; here we built a vast low building to be
warmed from the perpetual heat of the star’s
volcanic fire. Time passed on.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we receded from the sun our fears became
greater.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again we came where we could see our Earth,
almost a moon. Then we departed into colder,
darker space.</p>

<p class='c013'>Snow fell constantly until the forest disappeared
under a white bank. The volcanoes
were cloaked almost to their tops. The surface
of the land was changed.</p>

<p class='c013'>We had wood for fifty years in our cellars.</p>

<p class='c013'>The smoke from the islands of the sea told us
that the life of the star was still existing.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Day became twilight. On the snow it was
inexpressibly gloomy. The sky grew black; we
were entering a night of years.</p>

<p class='c013'>About this time it became so cold that it was
unsafe to go into the open air to look. We
could only venture out in a hollow case of skins,
with lamps about us for warmth.</p>

<p class='c013'>We made all our investigations through triple
plates of glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the bird people fell into a sleep from
which it was impossible to wake them. We put
them into a great hall by dozens, where they lay
motionless, lifeless to all appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin, Regan, Isabella and I were
alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Day after day we watched our dear, far sun
receding, and, as we gazed on the desolate, purpling
waste, we wondered if we should find it
possible to exist until the night was past!</p>

<p class='c013'>Such an awful sky! The sun only as a taper
in it!</p>

<p class='c013'>The star was so small! Would it continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>safely on or would it drop down upon some
larger sphere?</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we all became aware that another form
or presence was among us! Like a black mist it
entered and stood beside the fire, sometimes
remaining for hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a time each observer feared to mention
the phantom, lest the others prove that it was an
illusion of the mind. We were afraid of the delusions
of darkness of twenty years. But when
we all began to watch for it together, we spoke
of it. All had seen it, had heard its step, had
felt its touch.</p>

<p class='c013'>Prisoned, we could venture out no more. It
was dangerous even to go into the corridors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin had been writing from remembrance
the condensed books of the Bible.
He had finished his work so far as to have reached
the words which were spoken by the dead
man on that night when we left Earth:</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I will give him the morning star.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“I wonder what was meant when that was
written?” said Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned his head upon his hand and seemed
in deep study.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shade had been for hours beside the fire.
Now it crossed the floor and touched him upon
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come!” it said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is Gregg Dempster!” cried Regan. “It
is his voice! There is no God! Oh! if there
were He would do this!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin rose, took his staff and his
books and went after his guide. We followed
along the corridors, through doors which we had
not opened, out into the last corridor, where the
cold stopped us.</p>

<p class='c013'>We saw them go out into the dark cold, the
two, side by side, like spirits moving across the
snow, Father Renaudin in his crimson robe, his
hair blown like silver, his books clasped in one
hand, his staff in the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>The darkness hid them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>I would have married Isabella if I could have
ever gained courage to so defy Regan. Now
Father Renaudin was gone and there was no
hope of his return.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are things in this star which were
never on Earth!” said Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she threw herself down beside Regan
and, leaning her head upon the arm of his chair,
sobbed and wept in frightful passion. She looked
only at Regan, Regan—never at me!</p>

<p class='c013'>But Regan looked at me, with a face like a
demon’s, where was such horrid cruelty and rage
that I shuddered. And still he touched the
bowed head gently and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor child, he will return!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was of no use to hope. Calamities and circumstances
seemed to me to be in Regan’s control!
He would never give her up!</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no humanity in our wonderful
endurance!” said Regan, at last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why should we keep up this fraud of hypocrisy?”
sobbed Isabella. “We are lost!-utterly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>hopelessly, everlastingly most miserable!
Oh! I wish I could see the sun! I wish I
could see a woman’s face! I wish I could hear
the little children laugh! I hate these yellow,
churning seas, this volcanic world! I can never
leave it, never, never!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Still the days went on. We wrote, composed
music, painted, devised dramas and made plans
for their presentation. We coined money, we
made statuary in stone. We hated it all in our
darkness and desolation.</p>

<p class='c013'>As day after day we sat beside the fire, from
hating fate, Regan and I grew to hate each other,
hate as two who were dead and laid in two separate
graves of black might hate each other if
angelhood were to be won by only one of them!</p>

<p class='c013'>Did not Isabella see and know, when she carefully
removed every implement which might
serve as a weapon?</p>

<p class='c013'>Did she fear when we sat glowering sullenly
at the fire and dangerously at each other? Did
she not constantly talk, talk, sing, sing?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>I think that human beings must all grow dangerous
if they do not see the sun. One-half this
sentiment, which we call “gentleness,” “humanity,”
“mercy,” is only sunlight!</p>

<p class='c013'>We were not much troubled when the star
began to shake in its shroud. If the rocks
should fall, what then? Possibly we should
have no more of the terrible life to endure!</p>

<p class='c013'>The shocks grew worse and worse. One
night, as we sat hating beside the fire, a part of
the wall fell down. We could see the cold, far
stars shining into our house, that house which
we had builded so strong! The dreadful breath
of cold like steel struck upon our faces!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was but for one instant. For once I
thought quickly. I caught Isabella in my arms
and rushed into the tunnel where the rocks were
warm. Where Regan went I did not see.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>I did not know what had happened. I did not
see the walls fall down. It was very dark,
and some one held my arm. Then I saw the
flare of a torch.</p>

<p class='c013'>I could hear no voice in the commotion, but it
was upon Roy Lee’s face that the light of the
torch fell. I saw his steel blue eyes in quick
search for the cave look swiftly around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Above our heads the tunnel walls were roofed
with trees laid crosswise. These were coated
with ice; long icicles depended like white swords,
gleaming above our heads.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the torch expired we should die in
darkness!</p>

<p class='c013'>Roy fastened it carefully among the frozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>boughs. Then he came to my side and pushed
away from my face the fur cloak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come where I can look upon your face,
Isabella, for I love you! I have loved you
always! When the torch dies out we shall not
see again until we see in Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I sat beside him and we watched the
torch and spoke of the drear years which had
passed, in which we might have been so happy
if we had known!</p>

<p class='c013'>And then I remember nothing!</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>RED LIGHT.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Walls of rock crashed beside Regan; he
fell into a chasm where before his eyes
flowed volcanoes’ fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air was sulphurous. The sea swept upon
him through the cleft rocks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even he was appalled! Alone! Both dead!—Isabella
and the man who would not marry
her, who would not love her, his beautiful sister
Isabella!</p>

<p class='c013'>For Regan did not know that they were saved.
He had no time to see what had happened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But still I live,” he cried, “and we shall
reach the planet sun of Jupiter after a time! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>will take courage! It is only a custom of man to
expect companionship! One can exist just as
well without it! No human voice! No human
love! No kiss! No help! No words! I will
go on alone! I can go on alone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then for awhile he was silent, looking about
him. After a time he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will not do; there is no one to cheat save
myself and my own soul! Shall I try to lie to
it? Oh! tortured soul! If I only could believe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan cast himself beside the molten flood,
waiting his doom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah! Rondah! I shall never see you!”
he moaned. “Did you die in the snow? Where
are you? From what place do you see me?
Oh! my love, my love!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The air grew sulphurous with smoke. The
rocks fell between him and the sea, and others
fell between him and the lava.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was too lethargic to look. The habit of the
globe had seized upon him! He fell asleep for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>years! For people are a part of that globe
which they inhabit. They do not realize it, but
they breathe, move, think, exist, according to its
spirit, as a portion of it!</p>

<p class='c013'>If world still call to world, as they did when
the morning stars sang together, the voices are
of different attunement, but they blend in one
grand chord of harmony.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jupiter marched on, attended by his satellites.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little light fell upon the white ball; far off,
the sun, as a day-star, gave a grayness to the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The winds were dead. They did not move the
smoke above the craters. Asleep with the stars,
asleep was Regan!</p>

<p class='c013'>On, on came that burning planet, which has
yet to cool from lava seas to the crust of continents,
yet to jar and burst, and flame with
deluges of the first ocean’s fall, yet to pass
through all the cataclysms of universal epoch,
before there shall be upon its surface one pulpy,
spongy thing that has the lowest form of life!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>As one leaf among ten million has Nature’s
time to fall, so in Nature shall come the time for
a globe to bloom, among myriads, as unnoticeable
in the multitude sweeping before the vision of
the Lord as is the one leaf on the tree!</p>

<p class='c013'>Time shall come when it shall add a world’s
souls to the kingdom of the Redeemer!</p>

<p class='c013'>When the small sun and red Jupiter shone at
once upon the star it made strange daylight.
The great planet sent red, burning beams ahead.
Brilliant scarlet was his day.</p>

<p class='c013'>What spirit would fall across space from such
a fiery mass of convulsion as Jupiter? Nothing
quieting, nothing holy, nothing merciful! A red
light—only a red light!</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon one spot in the star the cold touched not,
the snow did not fall. The Sun Island, as the
bird men named it, was as calm as Paradise
through all these years!</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a piece of the sun it slept in snow. What
was beyond its blazing walls no one knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this white brilliancy, when Jupiter had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>brought daylight, came forth Father Renaudin.
Across the waste of snow he walked serenely, an
unearthly rapture upon his face. Storms could
not ruffle his crimson robe, nor was he touched
by the chill breath of the wind which had wakened
for Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By and by,” he was saying, “I shall know
all. I shall have passed beyond the reach of
forgetfulness. I shall be troubled by no such
paltry remnant as earthly remembrance. Somewhere
and sometime I shall be freed from the
clogs of this non-understandable machine, the
human brain! This atom, borne apart from all
the isles in the ocean of immensity, shall come
one cycle nearer to the æon’s goal, the end of
time!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin was not dismayed at the
approach of the star to the great planet. The
crash of worlds could not shake the faith of a
man come from the Sun Island!</p>

<p class='c013'>And the days of Jupiter became more brilliant
than ever with red light.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>A TRIUMPH.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Snows and seas began to melt, as at the heat
of a giant torch; loosened snow fell in avalanches;
wind and waves piled masses of ice in
walls. The frozen soil under all these powers was
crushed and cracked. The sky, where clouds had
been frozen out, again filled with moisture. Gold-red
burned the snow; the black peaks of lava
for their darkness melted deep pits around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The equatorial region swept clear of bonds;
lava isles cooled upon snow fell where the sea
washed out their foundations and splashed into
the depths, where the ice alone floated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the ravines was a forest of stunted
pods, which only bloomed for Jupiter. They had
slept since the star met the planet at the same
distance before. Now they crept out into the
glare—imps, dwarfed and small winged, an inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>creation, unshuddering in the cold, blinking
their first gaze at a burning ball, more
astounded at their own existence than at the
strange theatre whereon they stood, unfrightened
in the snow, homeless.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan awoke. It had been years since he
slept, but he did not know it; he wandered out
into the cold.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the same time Roy Lee woke. He glanced
up at the torch still burning, wondered when
the icicles melted, looked for Isabella and found
her gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where was she?</p>

<p class='c013'>He went out to seek her with that same fear in
his heart which had tortured him for months
before he fell asleep—the dread that the unscrupulous
Regan would rob him of the woman
he loved. The fear had all the growth of months
of desperation when he had hated and planned
through a dark, horrible season, when he had
thought and thought, and almost determined——</p>

<p class='c013'>Roy Lee on Earth was a man of honor. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>a great mystery to him when he lived there how
men became so depraved as to commit some of
their terrible crimes. It was no mystery now.
In those long, hating days he had come to know
that it is the great power of all those other souls
in the world which holds the man of Earth in
check to civilization.</p>

<p class='c013'>When there are three people in one world,
how much better, sometimes, that there be only
two, there being no law, no knowledge, no hindrance
to the deed save one man’s will to hold his
hand, and the fear of a God away, oh! so very
far away—somewhere!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was years before, but not so to Roy Lee, as
he stood again overlooking a gray sea, not knowing
that his sleep had been of unusual duration,
regarding his safety as one more of the mysteries,
with Isabella lost, remembering his hate as yesterday’s
hate, his fear as present as the fear of
last night, the fear that Regan meant to take his
life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t wonder,” he muttered to the cliffs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“that Cain killed Abel! I only wonder that
Abel did not kill Cain before he had a chance to
strike!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A lurid glare, as if it were a trail of blood, fell
across the snow. The red Jupiter rose before his
astonished eyes. The rays scorched his cheek
like a near fire. Then he heard a step; he
turned; there beside him stood Regan, with dark,
furious face, scorn in every lineament, the grand,
fierce eyes raging at the uncontrollable in Nature,
that expectant, defiant gaze, which to Roy Lee
had become so dreadful.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it would not have happened even then, if
Regan had not spoken, or even if he had said
any other words, for Roy Lee called back to
remembrance his earthly teaching. This man
had been his friend in trouble, had saved his life!
It was a sin to bring death upon a soul! Somewhere
there was a God!—and he took away his
hand from the hilt of a dagger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me at once where is Isabella!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was no friend speaking to friend. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>an insolent, imperious demand—sovereign to
subject!</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is saved from you forever!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Low, hoarse, almost whispered were the words.
A dagger blazed crimson in the sun as it fell, fell
twice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Roy Lee looked away; he looked across the
black, tossing, groaning sheet of water, where,
like golden coffins, the huge blocks of fiery ice
bobbed up and down in the black waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Far off in the inky sky swung a faint star.
There were struggling nations scattered all over
it. These nations held very serious beliefs.
Generally speaking, they considered murder
wrong, unless it were the murder of an army!
They had grand laws—a great many of them!</p>

<p class='c013'>But what could it matter to Roy Lee, the belief
of those people who lived in that particular star?</p>

<p class='c013'>Before him fire-red snow peaks rose against a
violet sky; iced spires cast gleams of fire into
his eyes from their shining tops. From ashen
chasms of unsunned snow the hideous imps peeped,
grinning at him.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Jupiter burned and blazed at Roy Lee. The
little Earth shuddered. An island fell into the
sea and set the ice coffins dancing. Winds howled
requiems in the steeply crags above his head.
At the north some breaking ice fields groaned a
knell. Roy Lee did not hear them; he was
listening for something else—to hear Regan
fall!</p>

<p class='c013'>Slowly, shielding his eyes from the full sight
with his hand, he turned partly toward him to
look. All the earthly horror of his crime came
sweeping to his soul. There were no voices to
cry “murder,” unless he heralded himself! No
newspaper would put his name under that awful
combination of letters! If it were chronicled,
his own hand must cut it into the rock! But
some things were the same. Human love, human
hate and human ferocity were just the same in
the one sphere as in the other!</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh! he was dead! Man of earth might be
horrified! The heart of that one man of the star
was triumphant above all horror!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Oh! he was dead!</p>

<p class='c013'>Roy Lee looked out upon the shady north,
where there was neither red Jupiter nor pale
sun, pausing a moment yet before he could gaze
upon his achieved triumph. Blue-black sky was
cut across by a bank of unmelted white snow
framed in by lava cliffs.</p>

<p class='c013'>There, with face stern and awful, his silver
hair flowing about his head, his crimson robe
clear against the violet sky, his grand form
upright, his shining staff uplifted as if to call
down God’s  vengeance, stood Father Renaudin!</p>

<p class='c013'>Beside him was Isabella, of the superb beauty
of the moment seeming a part, with ashen face,
parted lips, and steady eyes gazing past him,
ever past Roy Lee, at something else!</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the torch dies out we shall not see
again until we see in Heaven!” He remembered
he had told her that. Now, at what was she
looking?</p>

<p class='c013'>Roy turned to where Regan had stood.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stood there still, and from the point of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>withdrawn dagger he was shaking his own heart’s
blood!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin, come here!” cried Roy
Lee, in an awful voice. “Come here! Am I
mad, or has the world gone mad? I’ve killed a
man! I’ve killed him and he does not die!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no God!” whispered Regan, “there
is no God! There can be none, but, if there
were one, all-merciful and a rememberer of the
agony of human hearts, He would permit this!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>UNDER THE LIGHT OF TWO SUNS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>“Traitor and murderer, Roy Lee!” said
Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Roy saw that close beside him stood
Isabella. She clasped his cold hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was for Isabella,” whispered Roy, “and I
shall kill you again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Another island fell into the sea. The ice of
the north waved and crashed. None of them
heard it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin came to draw Isabella from
Roy’s side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will not leave him!” said she, clinging
fast to the arm of a murderer.</p>

<p class='c013'>For woman’s love does not change for spheres
or stars, neither for murders!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can it be possible that it was for jealousy
that you struck?” exclaimed Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How could you be so mistaken? Isabella is
my sister! I supposed you were aware of the
fact! There is another woman whom I love!
Her name is Rondah!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! why not have told me this? The misery
of years has been so terrible! A word
would have saved me! I need not have stood
under the light of two suns a murderer—I, Roy
Lee!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Remorse, agony, shame! But nothing could
undo the deed! It was committed! Not even
a death to come, when it could be, at least, forgiven!
No death upon the star! Always a
murderer!</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella stood by him. If it were not for that,
he would have lost himself in utter despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The attempt is a failure, Roy! It is a wonder
that you waited so many years before attempting
my death! But let that pass. We are
united once more. Father Renaudin is here.
Seas and convulsions may part us at any time.
If you love Isabella, marry her!” and, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>most ceremonious politeness, Regan returned to
Roy Lee his dagger.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it was Regan, Regan, Regan, who gave to
Roy Lee his wife! It was Regan who ordered
that the murder should never be referred to
upon the star so long as it should whirl!</p>

<p class='c013'>In the light of a burning world, their carpet the
black lava of a cooling one, their witness a man
who should be dead, the pastor a man who had
passed beyond the bounds usually allotted to the
understanding of mortals, who stood one step
nearer angelhood, were they wedded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Father Renaudin explained to them how
long years had passed while they slumbered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blessed sleep!” exclaimed Regan. “I am
so much nearer—”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah!” finished Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bird people woke after a time. When
the spring of years had come they had again
created a paradise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Great fields of fertile lands were cultivated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>beautiful towns erected. Magnificent prodigality
of color and foliage in Nature aided them in
beautifying. If they planted a sapling, in a few
months it flourished—a great tree! All their
plans were ably seconded by the people. If
they polished and cut a stone, a hundred pairs
of willing hands made each another stone look
just like it.</p>

<p class='c013'>They cut through the narrow continent, and
so moderated its temperature by allowing the
warm waters of the volcanic and torrid south to
come into the cold northern seas; they made
several such canals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan was restless and very unhappy.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been wandering in his gardens one
evening, when the star was white with Earthlight.
After awhile he turned away and sought
Father Renaudin where he sat beside the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan drew a low couch to the side of the
table and watched him, silently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?” asked Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin, it is all worth nothing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>worse than nothing! It is endless repetition of
misery with each day! It is a beautiful world,
but it lasts forever! That is too long! It is a
subject world, completely so! If I could see the
face of that one woman whom I love on Earth, I
would give all, all!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now you speak the truth of years of sorrow!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not have brought her here instead of
this one?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I meant to do so, I would have done so. I
looked that night at her fair, girlish face, so
frail, her divine eyes, which always smiled at
me. I noted how frightened she was, how weak
and like a spirit; too ethereal to be brought to
such a winter, to a land not done with its own
creation, where no sunlight should brighten to
gold her red hair, where her face must be ever
blanched with danger! I left her, Father Renaudin,
where kind Destiny—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say God, Regan!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Had placed her hand in mine! I put her
out into that winter night of Earth—because I
loved her! More dreadful than any other sound
upon this star is that echo which no tumult can
drown, which I ever hear—Rondah’s cry when I
left her! Soul reader that you are, I don’t believe
you know one tenth the torture of that
remembrance! If she were here, oh! if she
were here, the sea might swallow the towns, the
volcanoes bury my people, but this black lava
ball would be a paradise!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Was that Regan, abandoned to such grief that
Father Renaudin was alarmed? Men did not
die, but they might go mad!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan, be calmer! I have a hope for you,”
cried Father Renaudin, “really a hope for you
and for Rondah! I pity you! Know that I, too,
have loved, have loved and lost hopelessly!
You need not be hopeless! I learned a secret
of importance at the Sun Island! This will be
the last revolution for you to reach Rondah!
At the next the star will be captured by Jupiter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and will whirl as one of the satellites about it
until the end of time! You can gather your
people, build and adorn! There will be little
more destruction, no more such winter! The
heat of Jupiter will transform the star into a
world of most luxuriant vegetation! The geological
changes are very rapid on such a small
globe. These volcanoes will cool and die, those
at the south acting as the safety-valve of the
sphere!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Rondah? What of her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I tell you, hope! I can say no more!
Gregg Dempster, moved only by man’s curiosity,
reached the star by powder mines and a detached
hut of spiral springs. You are moved by a
greater power. You ought to be able to reach
the Earth and return once more!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>AN OLD FRIEND.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>More like a gorgeous dream became the life
of each day. The sea of gems was rippling
in its blue. The glorious islands were purple
and pink in mist and bloom. The air was laden
with perfume from gold, silver and purple trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>Earth came to be a great moon.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the light of the night walked Regan, pondering
ever the same subject. He noticed a shade
upon the silver sheet of the fountain. He looked
up. Huge black and beautiful wings flapped
above his head about a great bronze body.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then a bronze and shiny angel stood before
him, grand and dark, but with no shade upon the
radiant face, with benediction in the gaze of the
great, calm eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was wondrous sweetness in the voice
which said:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Worshiper of Destiny, worship God!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But at the sound of the voice Regan was cold
with awe; it was but the voice, more beautiful,
of his earthly friend, that feeble, maimed, disappointed,
dying old man, who only of all the
Earth had found Regan to be most kind, most
true. That one who had died stood here now, a
thing to reverence, not asking aid. But Regan
remembered him still as a friend, forgot not
those promises made on Earth, called on the man
although he beheld the angel:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gregg Dempster, it is our star now! We
both are here! You receive the reward of your
long labor, the fruition of your abiding faith! I
stood beside you until you came here! Let me
go back to Earth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave your star! It is your kingdom! It
shall be yet more lovely and more pleasant!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The beauty torments me! Let me go to
Earth! The woman I love is there! Her name
is Rondah!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, her name was Rondah!” said the voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of his friend once more. “How do you hope to
return, Regan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was a hermit, blind, feeble, dying. I
was his friend. There is an angel, powerful,
kind—he will be my friend!” answered Regan.
“You, who are like a God, can create!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! torturing mortal, cease! Man of earth,
I cannot create! If only I could!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet a higher Power!” whispered Regan.
“If there were a God, it would be like this! Is
there then something still withheld that an angel
longs for?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In this star, yes—not in the later heavens!
On Earth I prayed for another life; now I am
living it! I can only govern something already
created!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Harness a satellite!” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if I unbalance the poising of the universe,
bring suns and stars clashing into chaos?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still I must go! I can see her before they
fall!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan, think! No more should Rondah be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>fair young girl! Those earthly faces have changed!
They are dead, some of those on Earth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah is not dead!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She may be old, bent, wrinkled, uncomely!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For all that I must go back! She is my
love! Do you know what I know? She was
never beautiful! Her brown eyes were heavy
with fatigue, her pale face almost always dull,
her hair coarse, her gnarled hands, even then,
marred by toil from which she must not rest!
Now, she is old, cheerless and broken-hearted!
She thinks me dead! I doubt if she can smile!
Poverty has followed her all her life! Care has
weighed upon her! Loneliness has dwarfed her
intellect! Ignorance has kept her very silent!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once, when I was a desperate, ragged vagabond,
she came to my side and whispered: ‘Do
not be utterly discouraged, Regan! You are
different from the others, greater than those who
despise you!’ Later, when all men shunned me,
when they complained that my name disgraced
their country, she said: ‘Regan, so long as I live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>you have always a friend! I am poor, but I am
one in the world!’ Now, I want her here to
share my throne! I want her here that I may
give her a world!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Foolish man,” said the angel, “I am very
sorry for you! The whole star is yours; for this
one woman will you leave it, lay down your
mission for which, of the race of men, you were
particularly born? For a woman a world! For
love a kingdom! For a remembered sentiment of
Earth the substantial honor of a gift from gods!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All for her!” answered Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you return, take up age, toil of Earth,
die?—most horrible of all, to die!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Death is the most surpassing mercy of the
life of man! Nothing is so dreadful as to live on
forever!” answered Regan. “On Earth I can
die! Remember Earth enough to pity human
grief! Answer humanity with human gratitude!
Let me go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will take you back to Rondah, Regan! If
you do not understand, remember Rondah was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>also a friend to a desolate old hermit, who lived
alone in a comfortless hut in the lonely hills!
In ten days, be ready!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was gone like a vanished flash of light.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was my friend, that grand angel of superhuman
power! Why is he here? It is the one
great purpose and prayer of a life brought
beyond the grave! He whom I thought a helpless,
feeble old man, whom I pitied for his weakness,
forgot between times, the same that I saw
lying dead, cold and still upon his shabby bed, he
came here before me! This star he has shared
with me! If there is a heaven, his Sun Island is
a piece of it; ’tis blest with the security of a
heaven! Do these things chance? Can Destiny
be blind, be driven, blunder on such successes?
Can these rulings be a part of stupendous chaos?
Can nothingness do all things? Am I, are these
rocks, do I live? Oh! if I could believe in that
God of Father Renaudin! Alas! there is no
God! But if there were one, infinite, loving,
He would do this!”</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>THE HEADLESS MEN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>It was now more than twenty years since
Regan had cast the bodies of the headless
bird men into a deep chasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked up to see the sunrise after his angel
friend had left him, and behold! those unfortunate
victims of experiment were coming like
ghastly shadows, falteringly, down the hill over
which was the glory of dawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>With their heads in their arms, they stumbled
along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan, for an instant, would have fled, but he
stopped himself. Should a monarch run away
from his own experiment? He defiantly waited
the coming of the specimens of his mercilessness,
with horror of their reproaches.</p>

<p class='c013'>They came close to him. He saw that the
heads were also living, separate from the bodies!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>From the bodies, as they had lain upon the
ground, had sprouted little heads, which had not
grown, as they should, upon the neck. The
many-headed creatures seemed all alive; they
stood, complaining that they had not been able
to find their own heads!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one thing to call them “vegetables.”
It was another thing to have vegetables with
souls stand, asking a man to undo the wrong he
had committed, but could never repair!</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan looked at them, helplessly; they seemed
a group of heads—heads, nothing but heads and
eyes!</p>

<p class='c013'>He fell down, insensible!</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not open his eyes again until the noonday
sun was blazing down. They were still
standing, headless, waiting! Regan staggered
to his feet. Through all his cruelty, through all
their miserable years, they had yet faith, strong
and perfect faith, that this man, their king, would
and could restore them to their old life! And
Regan knew he could do nothing!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>All the land and sea and air began to burn in
a transparent glory. The sun itself was lost in a
greater splendor. Dim, golden forms in tremulous
radiance moved ceaselessly. Vibrating
chords of a transcendent song came thrilling all
the space. Beyond this miracle of whitening
glory, swept along in a chariot of purple and
gold, was a great dim gate, rising as one dark
cloud rises beyond a misty white one. Through
these moving portals was a glimpse of a bewildering
vision which made the star seem dark! So
rise the God-lit heights of Heaven beyond the
gates of pearl!</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet Regan knew this was not Heaven. No;
it was only a translation from the star to some
greater glory. There were winged angels indistinctly
flitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan saw hundreds of thousands of his bird
subjects rise, until they seemed all to go. He
feared there would be none left. Turning from
him with songs of rapture, they rose into angels
before his very eyes, as birds flying in flocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>from a shady forest come into a sunshine of
yellow light.</p>

<p class='c013'>For hours the bewildering sight continued, engrossing
his entire attention. Then the forms
began to recede. First, he could not see the gate.
Then the angels seemed only like stars. Then
there was nothing but a cold blue sky after
sunset.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where he had seen flakes of brightness loosed
from the throne, he looked at a dull, common sky,
giving no hint of the sphere beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw nothing. But they had been there.
Where had they gone?</p>

<p class='c013'>He gazed about to see if any of his bird people
were left.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had forgotten. They stood there yet, waiting,
those terrible headless men! The assembled
multitudes had looked upon the result of his
experiment!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go away! go away!” shrieked Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>The revulsion of feeling was awful. He had
been looking at the glory astray from Heaven.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>He looked on deepest human misery. He had
not only spoiled more than twenty years of their
existence—he had kept them back from translation!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go away!” he repeated, wildly. “What if
Rondah should ever see these men!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have waited over twenty years!” insisted
the speaking heads.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Regan controlled himself and tried to
imagine what he should do; he could think of
nothing, nothing, unless he imprisoned them
once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>A footstep was heard beside him. It was
Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! my sister, see them! They are here!
I cannot save them! They will not go! What
shall I do? The worst of all is they have the idea
that I can save them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan was utterly confounded, hopeless.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God they live!” cried Isabella. “They
are not dead!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish they were! Look at the heads!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“All mixed up!” said Isabella, with a philosophical
acceptance of the inevitable. “Regan,
we will encase them in the pods and the heads
will graft themselves to their proper places!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So this was what they did. They corrected
the misappropriation of heads, set them on the
necks and sewed the ten bird men securely into
ten empty pods.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They will emerge at blossoming time with
their troubles ended! I hope you will not experiment
again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan said nothing. She had not seen the
vision; she did not mention it. He left his
sister and went to ponder upon his eventful day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella, as soon as she was alone, proceeded
to experiment on her own account. Gathering
the little heads which had been severed from the
bodies she put each one into a pod.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whatever they may come to I do not know,”
she said to herself; “but I will not help to kill
anything! I don’t want deathless heads rolling
about this bewitched planet after me!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>CAN WE GO BACK?</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Roy and Isabella were watching the Earth
rise, when Regan, having assured himself
of his powerful friend’s assistance, came to tell
them of their leaving the star.</p>

<p class='c013'>He pitied their homesickness. It was he who
had robbed them of a life’s happiness. There
had been no particular gift to them from the
star.</p>

<p class='c013'>They could see the continents now upon the
world.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would you like to go back, Roy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Roy did not answer. The whisper which
never left him held him from replying; he only
looked sharply at Regan and listened to the
words, “Duped, duped!” in his own ear. Isabella
answered:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Would we return? Oh! gladly, yes! A
world in possession does not make a woman
happy! How tired I am of these rainbow seas!
I wish I could look at still blue water! How
tired I am of these flying people! I wish I
could see Rondah’s old grandmother hobble by
with her crutch! I am disgusted with the possession
of gold and silver and glass—of wealth
and station where these things are worth nothing!
I am smothered in these low clouds, in the
hot breath of this uncooled planet! Regan, you
do not jest? We can go back?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; we shall go back to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Next morning a huge meteorite, a mile in
circumference, hung, enveloped in a heavy cloud,
above the surface of the star.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin would not return. He could
not leave his people and his cathedrals. He
gave orders for several sacred books, which
Regan was to procure for him if he could do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My place on the Earth is gone from me,” he
said. “God is most kind. He gave to me a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>small sphere and more time. I shall belt this
star with one holy faith.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Isabella wondered that he was more pleased
with his distracting congregations of elf men
without much understanding than with all the
assemblages of grand, sinless bird men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He thinks he can improve the little sinful
elves,” said Roy. “It gives him something to
preach to!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The world was nearing. The meteorite must
be launched. With tears, Isabella bade Father
Renaudin an everlasting farewell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We shall not meet even in Heaven, for you
will not get there for ages!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the angel folded them away and they
whirled out into space.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin must not return!” said the
angel. “He has lived long past his allotted
days. He is a dead man on the Earth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They flew much swifter than Earth or star.
They swung into the clouds of a storm on Earth
and, in a moment, were upon the height where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>they had been thirty-three years and four
months before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look!” cried Isabella.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two looked at the angel. In the storm,
dark on the Hermit’s Hill, there stood no angel!
A bent, feeble, blind old man was there!</p>

<p class='c013'>Gregg Dempster!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two days to find Rondah!” he said to Regan.
“Isabella, Roy, farewell! Be happy on
Earth! Know the star was never for you! The
star is for Rondah!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>“HE HAS DONE THIS!”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Where was Rondah?</p>

<p class='c013'>All these years she had remained in one
place. Her grandmother died and Rondah fell
heir to the home and the hidden stores of wealth
which only she knew about. She had been so fortunate
as to be left to enjoy these treasures in her
own way. She cared for but few things in life.
Her hope was in a star, lost to view somewhere on
high. Flowers and sun were her treasures. Silver
and gold were piled in her cabinets. Brocades
and velvets and laces and jewels were
hers, her possession of which no one knew.
She had no friend save her hope. Around her,
her girl acquaintances grew old and left her.
Rondah saw that no change of age came upon
her. As years rolled on she realized that some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>unnatural influence was keeping her face the face
of a child. By the work of years she should be
gray-haired and wrinkled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it is so that the star comes back, Regan
will come for me! I know he will come! I
know he will come!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As it came evening time in the last year, Rondah
grew impatient with suspense and longing.
Those who noticed her at all, said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah watches for the Hermit’s star. She
does not know that it will not strike in the same
place this time!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But they were gentle people. No one cared
to tell Rondah this.</p>

<p class='c013'>One night, when storm-clouds had been darkening
the sky, Rondah, waiting with a tumult of
fear and hope which made her heart beat like a
hammer, mused sadly by her fire. It was splendid
about her, but it was lonely splendor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If he does not come,” said Rondah, talking
to the fire, “I shall die after this! I shall die
the sad death of a child! No one will remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that I have lived a woman’s life, suffered a woman’s
heart-break, earned a woman’s honor! No
hairs are gray upon my head to crown it; when
I lay it down in a coffin the people will very
soon forget me! Sometimes I seem a mysterious
monster to myself! Why do I not grow old like
other people, if it is not for the star?”</p>

<p class='c013'>She thought and thought until she could remain
quiet no longer. Looking out she saw that
the storm-clouds were piled in banks, aside, and
that the sun was trying to break through them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In two days more, only two days, after all
these years, and then I shall know! I cannot
rest! What if it should not come? Regan!
Regan! It is so many years!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She threw a mantle of gold and crimson
around her, wrapped a soft pink scarf about her
head, and went out in the cool evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>She took her usual route to the hill. She felt
hurried and anxious. She thought she should
see the star.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, her eyes took back their startled look,
her face grew pale.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>She saw a dark form in the path before her.
She stopped; her heart beat swiftly. It was not
time. She must not be deceived—a shock would
lose her reason. It looked like Regan!</p>

<p class='c013'>She went forward steadily, with dilating eyes.
She did not know that in the whole world there
was no one else so beautiful as was she, as she
hastened to meet the man in the path, standing
under the very tree where she had so often seen
Regan waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah scarcely breathed. She saw the man
lean forward and gaze at her with a close scrutiny.
The man’s face was plainly seen in the glow of
orange light which was after sunset.</p>

<p class='c013'>That man was Regan!</p>

<p class='c013'>The vales heard a wild cry—the town heard it—a
cry of joy from this heart, loveless for all of
a lifetime save for love from another world!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan! Regan! you have come! I knew
you would come! I knew you would come!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan had made himself believe that he should
find something so different! What could explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>matters to him? He knew that it was Rondah,
young, splendidly appareled, bewilderingly beautiful,
but the same Rondah, the same Rondah!
To mysteries he was accustomed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah! My own Rondah!” he cried and
clasped her in his arms once more. “There is a
God, such a thinking, loving world-mover as Father
Renaudin preaches! Nothing that blunders
could bring such joy as this to the heart of man!
There is a God who rules over all! Rondah, we
are again united! He has done this!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The darkness of the storm-cloud swept upon
them. Their chariot of rock and their angel
guide were there. It was time to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah, you are leaving the Earth forever!
Look back, look back! Are there loved ones
there to leave?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No! My loves have been in a different
Sphere!” said Rondah, and she laughed the happy,
careless laugh of a child. “Where is the star?”
asked she.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they saw it, serenely sailing far off in
the blue.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“It is our home, Regan!” said Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a world, a little kingdom!” answered
Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our home! The long, long years! I
thought they would never end! This time I
thought it would never come!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How came you to be so gloriously beautiful,
Rondah?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not know! It was hope in your coming,
I think!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was the blessing of a hermit, who has
become an angel!” said the angel-man. “Rondah
on Earth was robbed of many blessings. I
could bless her life with one chief happiness. I
chose beauty. Regan, did I choose rightly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! marvelously right! The angels will
stop to look upon her face when comes the next
translation!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are there people in the star?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin is there! He waits for
us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are no other humankind?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Only bird people with wings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall be as wise in my dullness as any in
the star!” said Rondah, joyfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!” Regan knew the clog of her dullness
had been a life-long torture to her. She
would be no more humiliated and pained with
her dullness there. Where the brilliant Isabella
had been so utterly miserable, this woman in
content would be a happy, happy wife!</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is our star! Do you see the multitudes,
hear their song of welcome? Do you see
them rise in flocks?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A grand world! Our world, Regan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What will you name it, Rondah? I have
never named it! I waited for you to come!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Wreathed in flowers, singing like silver bells,
the crowds rose toward them. White the walls
and domes glistened on the green plain by the
seaside below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our world forever! I will call it,” said
Rondah, “Parzelia!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The meteorite was stopped in the clouds of
the sky. The angel-man, bronze, strong and
glorious once more, flew down with Rondah and
Regan, and they stood upon the raised steps
of the great Cathedral, where all the assembled
multitudes could see them.</p>

<p class='c013'>For months previous to the departure Father
Renaudin had been calculating and preparing for
this return, for the ceremonial of the marriage
and coronation of Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sheets of yellow gold, spun fine and hanging
heavy, glistened on the columns and were spread
upon the floors, falling in rich masses to the foot
of the long flight of steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Rondah stood looking, a flock of bird
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>women flew from one of the spires above and
draped her in a veil and trailing robe of gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>With much state, Father Renaudin, accompanied
by a troop of elf men, alike in copying the
red of his attire, and decked with glass and gold
until they could scarcely trudge for their burden,
came to meet her. Father Renaudin, no older
than when he left Earth, with all the mark of
earth care gone, years gone from his face, came
to speak blessing, in which he even faltered. He
feared for an instant that Regan had again
brought to the star the wrong woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>For that Rondah whom he had known stood
no more before him. This gold-draped woman
had beauty more fair than Earth gave, had wondrous
eyes, glowing like stars. In her perfect
face there was the chiseled beauty of an angel’s
dream, not an earthly dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>But still, like Regan, he knew it was Rondah,
the same Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lengthy marriage rite was first—stately,
religious, slow. Even with its words Rondah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>kept thinking: “Am I here, or do I dream to
waken to the old, lonely misery?”</p>

<p class='c013'>With the benediction there swooped down her
subjects by thousands to kiss her robe or her
hand, or to caress her gold-red hair with one soft
touch.</p>

<p class='c013'>How kindly clear rang out their song of words,
“Our queen! the Earth-woman, Rondah!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I could never dream all this,” the queen was
thinking to herself, “I could never dream all
this! I don’t know enough!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a feast—flowers, fruit, shade and
multitudes. Then there was the short hour’s rest
between noon and sunset. At sunset were to
begin the magnificent entertainments which the
bird people had arranged in accordance with
Father Renaudin’s design.</p>

<p class='c013'>To a most lovely day was added the magnificence
of a most perfect star sunset, of itself a
wonder to the woman of Earth, the sea sweeping
a phosphorescent sheet of reflection and the land
bathed in brilliance which was blinding. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Earth moon rose and the bird people flew in
hosts into the sky; there they flashed lamps and
swung streamers of gorgeous colors, forming into
groups of circles stars, lines and crescents, to
make moving, brilliant gems in the sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>Last of all they swept in one mass, chaos of
light and color, for a single moment. Then clear,
motionless save for the slight shimmer of the
many wings, in the sky was one mighty crown of
flame.</p>

<p class='c013'>They flew down on the shores of an artificial
lake of large dimensions, where they lighted
lamps of various colors. Upon an island in this
lake they stood in statuesque groups, until from
water to the white temple built on the summit it
was a wall of beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>One ethereal bird woman just touched the
spire of the temple with her foot; her white veiling
robes made her like a goddess. She held in
each hand a lamp, and she shook from the same
hands two great, misty flags of softest golden
web.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>In a second’s time the same flags, like fiery
sheen, flew from every hand upon the rock, a
pyramid of golden glory and gorgeous light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the lamps were replaced by crescents and
stars of colored light, until there was nothing to
be seen of the bird people; like a scintillating
jewel the rock glowed.</p>

<p class='c013'>A cloud of whiteness, they swept into the distant
forest as a flame, bursting from the lower part of
the isle, wrapped the whole in fire from water to
temple top, a great torch from which the glow
fell upon the white stone and glass-paneled palace
which Regan had built for Rondah’s home—Rondah’s
home like the remembered homes of
Earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all this it was only the fairy-like women
who had sailed and shone. Now there came hundreds
of men, dark-robed, copying Regan’s taste
in dress, aware that there was a splendor of color
to lighten to glory any darkness in the splotches
of radiance on their cloaking wings.</p>

<p class='c013'>They bore a slight wicker car, cushioned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>crimson and covered with pendants of glass.
They carried Regan and Rondah, seated in this
car, above the summit of the loftiest peak.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over a vast surface Rondah looked upon moving
black wings, hiding all else. She was awed
with the exhibition of their immense strength, as
she saw it thus exhibited in one huge, moving
mass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can see nothing but a carpet of wings,” she
whispered to Regan; “but, if they would rise, I
could see the whole star.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few moments they did so. They swept in
a canopy above the car, and like a little ball the
star slept beneath them. In the midnight whiteness
of the Earth moon and its satellite there lay
its islanded seas, its banding continent, the fiery
south, the arctic north, the gray moonlit forests,
the white moonlit mountains, the mist-pale vales,
silver streams, diamond lakes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Earth was not so fair,” said Rondah. “Then
Earth was ponderous; no man could own all
Earth; it was beyond one man in its expanse of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>endless miles. This, our world, Regan, is within
human comprehension, within the grasp of one
man’s mind, under the sway of one man’s
sceptre.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You appreciate the kingdom,” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had feared a little that Rondah, with
her tastes moulded by custom of Earth’s poverty,
would not understand what an achievement was
the successful reaching and the continued ruling
of the star.</p>

<p class='c013'>She knew it all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah’s pleased laugh, like the joyous laugh
of a careless child, rang out in her delight, as
she contemplated it, and the murmur of the bird
men’s whisper of admiration sounded like the
sudden wakening of a breeze in the trees, for the
bird women did not laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Regan did not think that Isabella had
ever laughed when the people heard her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is that light like a star, that one
bright spot in the sea?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“That is the Sun Island. The angel-man lives
there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you not been there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. Father Renaudin spent years of the
last winter there, but he is silent about them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We will go there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is a wall in the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not for us. All the star is ours!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gregg Dempster and I shared the star.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can sail around the island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not on these seas. Everything sinks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The bird people will carry us there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They dare not go; like Father Renaudin
they are forbidden. There is a mystery on the
island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can go there, Regan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of all the stars why do you single out that
island, Rondah? Is there no other place so
interesting?” asked Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were descending. The island sank from
view. Rondah little thought where and how
she should see it next, as she slowly answered:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“No, it is not so much more interesting, but
something seems to tell me that I must go
there!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So has something whispered to me all the
years,” answered Regan, “and I have never found
means to go!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE EARTH HOME.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In the centre of a wide expanse of tableland,
walled at a distance by mountain chains, stood
the great stone palace which Regan had built for
their home.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was founded on a rise of solid rock, which
had been surrounded by three wide terraces,
rising each twenty feet above the other. In
width these terraces were one hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the foot of the terrace, on the south side,
was a great lake, artificially formed, from whence
the earth used in the terraces had been removed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the lower terrace was set a forest of
the silver fringe trees; these drooped over the
stone sides and made graceful shades in the still
lake. Along the edges of the terrace were set
colossal glass vases, which were draped with veils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of dark green satiny leaves and wealth of rose-hued
blossoms. In the second terrace were only
crimson leaved trees, and a row of giant white
statues stood along the wall, thrown into brilliant
relief by the color behind them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The third terrace had only the deep purple
velvet of the pansy tree. Above this rose, pure
white, the columns of the many-pillared palace,
which, about its roof, was decorated with glass
panels and numerous light-spired minarets. At
one side rose a glass tower with a dome overlaid
with solid gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan would have been glad to have built a
vast golden-domed roof for it all, but he must
remember the instability of his star; he must
build for earthquake, cyclone, flood and snow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within this palace were suits of great cool
rooms, some furnished and decorated, some left
for Rondah to furnish as suited her best. Above
all these, upon the walled, flat roof, was a lake of
water, wherein was an artificial glass island, upon
which was a golden temple; from this place Rondah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>could see the whole vale. At the north was
the restless, smoky sea; at the east the rows of
manufactories on the distant hills, their tall
chimneys smoking ceaselessly; at the south the
great silvery lake with its surrounding parks,
and, beyond, the houses of the city; at the west
the mountains and their forests, with the western
sunsets.</p>

<p class='c013'>How miraculous the change! From a small
house in a hamlet in an earthly wilderness to the
capitol of another world; from nothingness to
supreme power; from loneliness to happiness!</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” whispered Rondah, “shall we be
always so happy, Regan and I? These bird people
are always so, but I doubt if men and women
of our Earth leave, except by death, their misery
inherited. Perhaps, perhaps,” mused Rondah.
“But it seems more reasonable to me that trouble
will come to us here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah, Rondah!</p>

<p class='c013'>Blindly she groped after the great law, of
which she had one mental glimpse. She could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>not understand it, but with the unfailing intuition
of a woman she felt its presence. People of
Earth, wherever they live, must know sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All glorious and serene the star sailed now,
aglow with endless radiance and sunny warmth.
Its path was toward the sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan dreaded the winter and its dangers.
Ahead was storm, cold, earthquake, Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The elf men, the new race, had begun to be
insubordinate; they were as fond of demolishing
as were the bird men of building. They often,
from mere caprice, tore down magnificent structures
when they were left unprotected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But nothing is too much trouble to endure
now that you are here, Rondah!” Regan said.
“Until you came the star was dark!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And Earth was dark! It is not the sun which
lightens human hearts!” answered Rondah.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class='large'>“NOT RONDAH, WHO HAS NO STRENGTH!”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The great storm when the star turned, the
accompanying disaster, the horror of convulsion,
the sunless years—these were troubles which
Regan wished he could avert. With Rondah he
often wondered whether they might not spend
the winter in the Sun Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>In dreamy luxury the months and years
passed on. Rondah was happy and took no note
of time; it was for cycles, no need to measure
it by hours, no death ahead. Regan was busy
with great schemes. With the ideas of his mammoth
earth built upon the little star turned into
realities, the planet became a paradise of beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Deputations were sent around the length of
the continent to found cities on the broad inland
plains and have dwellings prepared for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>time when there should be no more winter.
These colonists knew that the winter sleep would
separate them entirely from each other, but they
cared nothing for that. It was no more than that
two forests were miles apart. Their somnolence
was with the whole star, a part of it. The bird
people, now engrossed with and ambitious for
Regan’s plan of improvement and commerce,
coined gold into beautiful, shiny, clinking money,
and were sorry that they must leave the pleasant
occupation and desist from their architectural
amusements until Jupiter dawned. They had no
other dread of their winter sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among other experiments, they set several
thousand small and crowded pods into a new and
fertile field. They saw that the withering or
uprooting of one of these destroyed its vitality,
and the backwardness meant a thirty-three years’
sleep for its occupant.</p>

<p class='c013'>One thought would not leave Rondah—to reach
the Sun Island. The bird people refused to go
there. According to her designs and instructions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>were constructed several various locomotives of
a kind intended first to sail in the air and later
to crawl in the sea. But none of them were successfully
used. The channel at one point was
almost bridged by a lava ledge, but not entirely
so, and the water was boiling in the strait.</p>

<p class='c013'>Summer passed. The star turned. Tumult
of earthquake, flood and tornado was all over the
land for days as before. But the surface was
now much more stable; the houses were constructed
with reference to these things; they
were in the centre of the continental plains, not
directly on the shore. There was no great damage
done.</p>

<p class='c013'>The planet receded from the sun into the colder
distance; the autumn haze settled for years upon
its peaked hills; the leaves changed hue for all
that long time; the sea grew cold and steely;
the sun faded and diminished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How will you endure the long winter?” said
Regan to Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not mind the darkness.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“You do not know what it is yet!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah, Regan, not from seas and their snows, not
from darkness and its despair comes the danger
which is so great that even now you feel the
horror of it upon your heart! Look otherwhere
than at the purpling sky; look away from the
barren and desolate mountains. It is not there,
it is not there!</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah was walking in the noonday light
through the paths beside the lake. The wind
soughed through the leafless boughs above her;
the light had the color of a partial eclipse; the
leaves rustled as she walked among them; they
recalled the rustling leaves of that oak-shadowed
path which was on Earth. Rondah wondered if
it were there yet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lifting her eyes, she saw a dark form moving
swiftly across the cliffs upon the very summit of
a distant mountain.</p>

<p class='c013'>She wondered at first who it was. Then she
remembered it could be only Regan. How very
fast he was moving over the difficult path. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>he could have reached that distance and elevation
in the short time since she left him Rondah
could not think.</p>

<p class='c013'>She turned in the path; when she came again
where she could see the cliffs, he was not there.</p>

<p class='c013'>When she entered the palace, Regan was reading
in the library. A new supply of the works
of the bird people had just been sent in from the
printing establishment and Regan was delighted
with some of the productions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at these books, Rondah. Here is one
in particular which is remarkable.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He placed the book in Rondah’s hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long,” said Rondah, “have you been
back?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have not been out to-day!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah opened the book slowly, thinking, but,
when she had thought, the red and gold volume
fell from her nerveless hands; she sank upon a
couch before the hearth and looked at the floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Were not you on the cliff?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I? Certainly not!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Some one was there—a man! I thought it
was you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A man or a bird man?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A man!” replied Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was his danger; Regan knew now. There
was everything to fear from another man—insurrection
of the elf men, helplessness of sleep,
horror of war, confusion of conflicting power.
An enemy! Powerful, else he would never be
able to endure the star! Wily, else he had never
been able to reach the star! He could see those
hideous troops of traitorous elf men, roused to
any pitch of enthusiasm by a few human words,
ranging in red lines over the cold snow like
streaks of human blood! Oh! all misfortune he
foresaw in that moment’s realization, but he foresaw
nothing like the true one!</p>

<p class='c013'>No death, no death, no death on the star! If
his enemy were there, he was there forever!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Possibly it was Father Renaudin. I will see
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan’s voice sounded strangely.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“What can he do, Regan?—the man!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They found Father Renaudin, meditating in the
blue, silver and crimson radiance of his own great
rooms. He was in possession of a large wing,
where the rooms had been given up entirely to
his use.</p>

<p class='c013'>When he looked up and saw them, he smiled
with the pleasure of an indulgent and idolizing
parent, who contemplates a couple of beautiful
children.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regan wore always the half-Greek costume,
tunic and cloak, which he had adopted upon coming
to the star. He had a suit of dark green,
the sleeves gold-slashed, the belts and clasps of
gold and gems. His shoes were yellow leather,
tied with long, gold-decked strings wound about
scarlet hose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah wore a long, loose robe of rose color,
belted with a bow of gemmed stars. A wide collar
of gems was on her shoulders, and a gemmed coronet
held the braided bands of her shining hair.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Her arms were hidden under a network of jewels,
which covered a close, long sleeve of rose
color.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How beautiful, young and strong they are!”
thought Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>He wondered that Rondah found never-ceasing
delight in the lonely pomp and splendor of her
position, wondered that the careless adoration of
the bird people as well pleased her as if it were
the thoughtful allegiance of humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>He noticed Regan’s face, pallid and stern, that
old fury in his eyes once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>He sprang to his feet. Better than any other
human being Father Renaudin knew the depths
of slumbering, chained depravity in Regan’s soul,
knew his destructive power when his rage was
kindled, his heartlessness unlimited when he
chose to become a tyrant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Always he was fearing that, for some aggravating
cause, Regan would destroy the people, if
not the star, before the time of Jupiter’s reign
began.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Father Renaudin—Father Renaudin!”</p>

<p class='c013'>No more words than these could he speak;
leaning against one of the pillars, he waited to
control himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was it for the presence of the other man?”
Rondah thought. “It must be, but why was he
so disturbed?” Then she said aloud: “I saw
a man walking on the cliffs; was it you, Father
Renaudin? Oh, was it not you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a cry, Father Renaudin started to his
feet, speechless; he shook his head at them,
looking with terrified gaze from an ashen, livid
face. Then he clasped his hands to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not this, oh, God, not this! Not Rondah,
not Rondah, who has no strength!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His utterance was slow and stifled; he fell
senseless upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cold yet from horror, Regan raised him to
the couch and, fearing the words of his return
to consciousness, he sent Rondah into another
apartment.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, after some time, Father Renaudin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>recovered, he looked where she had stood, and,
finding her gone, said to Regan:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never, never leave her! Watch! A doom
is upon her! Oh, there are no prayers of mine,
or deeds of yours which can avert it! Only do
not leave her! To reveal more I am forbidden!”</p>

<p class='c013'>If it had not been that it was impossible, Regan
would have killed him for those last words;
but he knew it could not be done. Smothering
his futile anger, he turned his dreadful eyes
away, with curses of mad rage in his heart
because his teacher was so fanatically given to
mysteries and silence; he asked quietly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was it Gregg Dempster who stood on the
cliff?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No! Gregg Dempster has been removed to
another sphere, years removed! His influence,
too, is gone! We must hope for no further help
from him! As humanity fights, we must fight
out our own fate! No! It was not Gregg Dempster
who stood on the cliff!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE SUN ISLAND.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>“If there be safety for Rondah anywhere, it
is on that island! I must find means to
reach it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was Regan’s final decision, the only salvation
which he could imagine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the bird people slept he ordered the
construction of a small, strong stone house, with
two great cellars stored with fuel, food and oil.
This was built as near the island as possible.
The glow of brightness made continual day
around it, but warmth hardly penetrated the
impassable wall in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was months before this was done; a faint
twilight was the only day on the star; the
breezes were cold and dry; the sea was partly
frozen, many of the ravines snow-leveled.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Hundreds of the bird people were already asleep.
The winter’s fate might depend on a day’s time.
Regan went to the house by the Sun Island to
see if it were ready. Father Renaudin remained
to protect Rondah. The doors were fastened
and the windows chained, and the shutters had
been almost all permanently locked for the winter.
A few windows of triple glass were left
uncovered for light.</p>

<p class='c013'>After Regan had gone, there came upon the
terrace a strange, the same one whom Rondah
had seen upon the cliffs, a grand and majestic
man; his golden hair fell in curls about his
shoulders; his face was like tinted alabaster, his
eyes superb in beauty and brilliancy; his powerful,
tall form was wrapped in a singular cloak of
emerald and gold sheen.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the foot of the porch steps he stood in the
snow, where the heavy winds swept rifts of white
upon his mantle, and waited for the woman of
Earth to ask him to enter. With the dignity of
a monarch, the beauty of a god and the elegance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>of manner achieved only in the grandest of
earthly courts, he stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah listened while he explained that he
had come at Regan’s command to carry her to
the Sun Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This day only the wall in the air is removed.
The bird people are asleep. I can take you
there quickly!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” said Rondah, “come in and give
me time to think! I ought not to go; I should
stay where Regan left me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is what he said you would say, and this
note he sent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah read it—Regan’s writing:</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>My Darling</span>: Do not delay; to-day only we
can reach the island. This friend can bring you
very swiftly in his car. I wait upon the shore
until you come. I shall return if you are too
late. It all depends upon you! Come instantly
or all is lost!</p>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Regan.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I will see Father Renaudin,” said Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>She returned a moment later, pale and troubled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin is asleep!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we must return for him. I am sorry
to inconvenience you, but by sunset the wall will
close! Then you will be shut outside!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father Renaudin?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We will leave him here for this trip. It is
too late to take him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah could not think. “Come instantly!”
“Come instantly!” “All is lost!”</p>

<p class='c013'>What if Regan had sent for her? How angry
he would be when her slowness had prevented the
use of this one opportunity!</p>

<p class='c013'>Wrapping heavy cloaks about her, Rondah left
the palace, carefully closing its door. They were
almost alone in its great rooms; almost all the
bird people were asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>She took a seat in the singular sailed car beside
the stranger. They flew like a cloud through the
air. As they neared the Sun Island the glare of it
made everything visible for miles around. Once
Rondah thought she saw Regan and some bird
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>men returning through the snow, but the stranger
threw the white-winged sails on that side the car
and she was not sure; he told her that it was a
rift in the snow where a volcano’s heat kept the
black rock visible.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will soon see Regan now!” he said.
“Look beside the island at the edge of the continent!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Still Rondah did not see him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is the blinding glare,” said her companion.
“I know where he is. I can see him!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The pale sun was blinking. The day was closing.
Swift, very swift, the car sank.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is the house Regan built. There is a
flying bird man. They are not asleep. You
have told me falsely! Regan is not here!” cried
Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it was too late. The car sank into the
white brilliance. The dark surface of the star
was lost to view. Rondah was upon the Sun
Island, even in her suspense and apprehension
to be astounded at its glory!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>“HE IS NOT HERE!”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>As she stepped from the car, Rondah heard a
chill, queer laugh. She glanced at the
stranger. Was it he? He stood beside the car
and was looking at her with a singular expression,
half triumph, half intense apprehension.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Rondah, looking at him, began to realize
that he had brought her to the island and left
Regan outside, the man touched the car. Its
sails expanded. It flew away; striking the wall
in the air, it fell a mass of cloth and fragments.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has returned—the wall,” said the man, composedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is Regan? He is not here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He waits outside the wall, I suppose! We
were a little late!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go after him!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“I cannot go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah fled toward the sea, only to be stopped
by the invisible barrier. She ran aimlessly and
helplessly about, sobbing and shrieking until she
was worn out. Then she sank upon a bank and
looked about her. Tossing her red hair from her
face, she struck her gemmed coronet and it fell
upon the rocks, where it looked like a piece of
brass on the jewel-like surface of the Sun Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>The amazing splendor almost blinded Rondah’s
weeping eyes. The cliffs were of garnet and of
yellow amber. They rose out of sight in the serene,
changeless radiance. The canopy of clouds
above the island was one sheen of rainbow hue.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rock surface of the Sun Island was of the
dazzling color and radiance of most brilliant polished
sea shell. Spots of pink, blue, green and
shades of emerald, gold, bronze, carmine and
rose, chocolate-brown, dull yellow and purple—all
these hues were so mingled as to produce
an exquisite harmony.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the deep ravines of the great riven cliffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>there were forests of silver-bodied trees, whose
leaves seemed metallic. They shone like diamonds
and tinkled like glass. The shadow of
their foliage was a pinkish hue, and the grass of
the valleys was like the white waxen petals of
the tuberose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beds of roses and lilies were in large banks
and on mountain sides; there were other jewel-like
blooms everywhere. The rivulets of liquid
pearl flowed ’neath banks shadowed by silken
reeds, which swayed like stray moonlight lost in
the fields.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the air was a musical thrill, which made a
continual chord of harmony around her.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stranger seemed gone. At least, he was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the shadow of the magnificent trees
Rondah sat to rest, and there was nothing in the
whole heavenly sight which could even calm her
grief. The island was beautiful, but Regan was
not there!</p>

<p class='c013'>The music of air and trees was supremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>ethereal, but she was miserable because she could
not hear Regan’s voice!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan! Regan!” she called. “He laughed—that
strange man—he laughed! I am certain!
I do not believe he thought he could bring Regan
here. I do not believe that Regan ever trusted
him. I was so foolish as that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And along the paths where never woman had
trod before, Rondah ran and searched, seeing
nothing of the beauty, only searching for Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>She overlooked a valley which surpassed all
dreams of beauty; beside the lakes was set a
fairy-like palace built from the amber rocks, its
decorations being only pillars of pale blue pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Into this place she went, searching. No one
was there. Upon the floors were draperies of
soft gray and yellow of a queer, silky fabric. On
the shelves were piled huge books, bound in the
silver of the trees, written on leaves of pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>After turning the leaves a little, Rondah threw
herself down upon the piles of gray cloth and
sobbed herself to sleep, for she knew it was night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>outside and that Regan had returned to the fireless
palace to find her gone. He was even then
searching for her all through the winter snow.</p>

<p class='c013'>She did not think that he could find her. She
did not think that he would try to come to the
island. A woman’s fortitude Rondah had not.
She had only a child’s strength to endure her grief.</p>

<p class='c013'>She woke to the same serene stillness, the same
superb beauty, the same song in the air. She
climbed to the tops of the garnet cliffs. Wild
and terrible her voice rang over the island:
“Regan! Regan! Regan! Regan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And in the day’s hours, when even outside the
island all troubles were easier to bear, Rondah
sat beside the books, which were so carefully
stored, and, considering her strange fate, she said
more calmly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have made a mistake, but there is no death!
I shall return to Regan after a time. He will fall
into the winter’s sleep, but it will be spring
soon!” and she turned the leaves of one of the
books.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Glancing, she saw bewildering words; reading,
she saw deep and awful meaning. Interested,
she began to peruse the books, the books which
Gregg Dempster had left for her. Nothing seemed
omitted from their chronicles back into ages
of a primeval chaos, which made “In the beginning”
seem near by, back to the great cause of
all causes, on through the series of destinies of
human souls from where they started to Earth,
from Earth to the eternal seas of ages, from
realm to realm, from plane to plane, from power
to power! All clear! All perfect! Mystery
which troubled her all gone! Rondah read on
and on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Possibly I was sent here to learn,” she said.
“These books are wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She laved her tear-stained face in the liquid
pearl, braided her wind-blown hair into its smooth
tresses, found her coronet and replaced it. Day
and night passed outside the island; she consoled
herself in the study of the strange, bewildering
books, and read on, read on.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“It will be spring by and by,” she said, “it
will be spring by and by!” and the strong peace
of the Sun Island calmed her grief; her tears
were dried, her heartache charmed into quiet,
her loneliness was forgotten. In the pinkish
shades by pearly streams, under diamond trees
and ’neath a rainbow sky, she almost forgot
Regan!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='large'>“GOOD-BYE!”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Regan returned to the palace as the darkness
was deepening. The lamps in the
great hall were unlit. Probably the bird women
were asleep, but he knew it was not that. Into
the silent rooms he hastened.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not there! No fire! No light! He ran to
Father Renaudin’s apartments. There lay Father
Renaudin asleep!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Awake! awake!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a groan of agony Regan called to him.
With a curse of rage he shook him, shrieking at
the senseless form:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Awake! awake! you sleeping traitor, and
tell me where is the wife whom I left with you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As well trouble the dead!</p>

<p class='c013'>Gone, gone, gone!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Regan rushed through the corridor with a
flaming torch, heedlessly stumbling on the sleepers
lying wherever they had fallen, heedless of
the fact that the cold was chilling the fireless
palace.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah, come back! Rondah, come back!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He repeated that call from the verandas; possibly
she had not gone far; she might hear. He
lighted a great lamp in the glass tower. She
would perhaps see the lamp and return.</p>

<p class='c013'>A white note lay on the floor. He seized it.
“Good-bye” was written on it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye! Good-bye!” Not for him those
words!</p>

<p class='c013'>He held the letters far from him and looked
at them. “Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah’s writing. Rondah’s paper, with the
crown in the corner. She had written on it
“Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Staggering to a chair, Regan sat before the
ash-covered hearth and crushed the white ghost
of love in his powerful hand. The cold was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>creeping all around him; he noted it not; a worse
chill was on his heart. He was fighting against
human suspicion with the remembrance of human
love!</p>

<p class='c013'>There it was to condemn her. “Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>In his heart was untold misery, but in his long
life he had gained in many things more than
human wisdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It looks like treachery! It looks like desertion!”
he admitted; “but in thirty-three hopeless
years on Earth she did not forget me! Can
she forget in a day here! A doom—that was
what Father Renaudin called it. It could not be
averted. It was to fall on Rondah; this has
fallen on me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye! Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But where would she go? That other man,
the one who walked on the cliffs! Regan had
never seen him; but Father Renaudin had seen
him and had reported to Regan his wonderful,
God-like beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Sun Island! Perhaps she is there!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Regan rushed into the night; darkness was
there; he could see nothing, but he cared for
nothing. The winds cut like a keen knife, but
a knife more cruel had cut his heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye! Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The winds howled those words. They would
say nothing else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah, Rondah,” he whispered to the night,
“it would have been better not to have written
it—‘Good-bye!’”</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw the blaze of light of the Sun Island;
he climbed the cliffs to his own stone house.
The bird people looked like corpses in the gray
light. He drank a stimulating liquid. He lighted
the firewood which he had ordered so carefully
piled to make a great, cheerful blaze for
Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>He sat beside this blaze and waited for the
whitening of darkness, which was day.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the sleep had not been almost death, they
would have wakened to mourn with him, those
tender-hearted, sympathetic bird people. As it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>was, they moved not while the awful sobs sounded
in the drear house.</p>

<p class='c013'>But why did Regan read, and again read, those
cruel words, “Good-bye?”</p>

<p class='c013'>When day came he strengthened himself with
food and went out to see if there was not a
frozen bridge to the isle. No; only a place
where over the shallows of lava there were
formed little, shifting, flake-like spots of ice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Regan brought the great sledges and for
three days he ceased not to throw cargoes of
snow into the sea where the waves were so shallow.
Not pausing for night, as if to save a lost
soul, he worked for three terrible days, and he
had almost bridged the short way.</p>

<p class='c013'>One sledgeful fell. It struck on the invisible
wall and rolled into the waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will not be stopped!” shrieked Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all his power he struck the wall; he
threw himself against it, he cast ice at it.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went back to the house, took another drink
of the stimulant, returned with a heavy sledgehammer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>which three bird men could not swing.
With this he struck the wall, that wall which
could not be seen. The concussion knocked the
hammer from his hand; the shock threw Regan
into the snow.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wall remained.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like Rondah, he called the name of the one
whom he loved. A new horror came upon him—he
was going to sleep!</p>

<p class='c013'>“My God, not this!” he cried when he saw it
was sleep and not weariness. “My God, not this
and Rondah still lost! Mercy! mercy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He dashed ice-cold water on his face. He
deluged his head and hands with snow. He
again roused himself with draughts of the powerful
stimulant and rushed back to the wall. He
was sure that she was there.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, death of years,” he cried, “stand back
until I find her, or come forever!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of all the star’s promise Regan neither remembered
nor thought. That with it they must live
he had forgot. Only for time to find her!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Half-asleep, he struggled over the narrow, icy
trails to that wall only to fall in the snow beside
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Do you not hear it, Rondah? So near, can
tinkle of diamond leaves and hum of musical air
drown that horrid call, as Regan, beating the
wall in despair, helplessly fighting off the sleep
which comes with the force of the star itself, a
force as resistless as that of tempest or earthquake,
falls with that paper clutched in his hand,
the paper with “Good-bye” written on it?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='large'>FORGETTING REGAN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The years passed changelessly in the Sun
Island, an emotionless period of waiting,
only serving to make her forget the past, forget
everything which she ought to remember, Rondah
thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>She knew that in the continual perusal and
study of the great books she was forgetting all
else, knew that her very soul was changing character
from them. When once in those books she
had read words, it was impossible to forget them.
The thoughts which were explained to her there
were limitless, unpuzzled, perfectly finished. She
never lost herself when trying to follow the mazes
of her mind’s flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, when she tried to think back, it was a dim
remembrance, as one remembers a far-away dream.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>She could not sorrow deeply. Alone, she was
never even lonely; there was the constant song
humming in the air. It cheered her.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the stranger were on the island, she never
saw him. She concluded that he was asleep with
the rest. She knew that the slumber came suddenly
and irresistibly upon all.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pink of Jupiter’s kiss had shimmered in the
brilliance of the isle for months when there came
into it a faint green tinge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder if it is almost spring?” thought
Rondah, looking up at the amber cliffs half-covered
with diamond-leaved forests. “I wonder if
it is almost spring?” and she looked longingly
away at the one rift in the burning garnet walls,
where beyond them she could see the purple sea
and reddish froth. No more was it cold, icy and
dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment, with its old, terrible intensity,
her heart woke to its misery, but only to still
heavily again.</p>

<p class='c013'>A step sounded on the soft leaves beside her.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Regan!” she cried, gladly, and sprang to her
feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>No, no; it was that stranger, emerald and glistening
and of angelic countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it spring now?” asked Rondah, without
preliminary. Perhaps he had come to take her
home!</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is winter, drear, dead, white winter. No
one has awakened yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whom?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. I have searched the star and all the
palace. I have not seen him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But this was false, for as the stranger entered
again the island, from which he had been walled
all these years, he had passed where Regan was
lying. Even as he spoke, and with so radiant a
face, he remembered where he lay, his black hair
frozen into the drifts, one hand, with Rondah’s
note crushed in its icy grasp, close to his heart,
the other helplessly frozen at the base of that wall.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>He was certain that he should not be perplexed
by his immediate presence. Still, he had admired
his perseverance and pitied, almost, his human
weakness when he had fallen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within these lovely vales once more with Rondah
beside him, he cared little for the man of
Earth, asleep in the snow outside the wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We shall both be glad when spring is come,
Rondah! I shall return to my own dear world.
Will you remain forever in the Sun Island or go
out into your little lava land again?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, not here! I shall go home. How much
longer must I wait?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very long yet!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very long?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have been here now almost thirty-three
years. This star, with all that it contains, or will
ever contain, is not to be compared with one of
the lesser mountains of my world! I was sent
from it to bring home a spirit which is so powerful
that it can carry through my world and to all
its satellites the truths of revelation! I was told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>who she was, and specially selected to come for
her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The stranger paused.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is she?” questioned Rondah; she was
only thinking: “Very long yet before spring, and
I am forgetting, all the time forgetting Regan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is fairer than earthly women, mightier
than all earth’s armies, than all its millions, for
she can save nations, yes, worlds of men from
Godless darkness. The fate of my sun and all its
dependents is on her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a strange, grand mission,” said Rondah,
“greater than ours of humanity. Why do you
waste these many years, while souls die, to find
her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she forgot him in remembering the revelations
of the books, what she had learned regarding
some of the constellations, with their beginning,
endurance and destinies. It was very
likely. Revelations were to every world, but
to none alike; they were taught by many differing
agencies.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“She will surely go to my sun, for she is good
and merciful. She is a wholly righteous spirit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You should find her at once. Souls perish
while you wait!” said Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have found her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is she?” again questioned Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“People do not know their brightest destinies.
Is not this a bewildering opportunity for one
to offer to man’s ambition—a constellation, its
ruling, its splendor and its salvation? Is not
the bait tempting—the bait of worlds and souls?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose so—to some,” answered Rondah.
“I presume that to Regan such an opportunity
would be impossible of rejection. If only Regan
had such a sun as that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then upon the stranger’s face there flashed a
malignant lightning; his eyes shot phosphorescent,
baleful gleams; but the expression fled in
an instant, and Rondah saw it not.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There the hills are diamonds, the rivers gold,
the leaves of rose hue and fragrance. The great
plains are of silver sheen.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“There merely human eyes would be blinded by
the splendor. In the vast, jeweled cities there are
the homes of men, the prosperity, excitement,
learning, love and enjoyments of Earth. There
are real people with noble hearts, perfect souls,
intellects of powerful capacity, not baby bird men!
There are huge and beautiful beasts, which are
harnessed for men’s pleasure! The mighty and
magnificent race are not of vegetable growth, who
need this one spirit to save them!</p>

<p class='c013'>“The sun is Jupiter! When it is so near that
you can go back, it will be spring—time for
Regan to wake. The sun is Jupiter! This star
is lost among its satellites!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Like bewitching music fell his words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Destiny is foreordained. The spirit whom I
love will go. My measureless love for her is part
of that ruling; her love for me must follow as
fate!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you love this spirit? If so, I am sorry
that you have sought her thirty-three years. You
know how long have been these drear winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>years for me, while Regan sleeps in the snow
outside the wall!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a shuddering cry; from the air or
clouds it seemed. It was like a laugh, a wail,
some moan of a lost soul. It frightened Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>She caught the momentary flash of hideous
wrath on the man’s face, but it was so quickly
gone that she was not certain she saw it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you accept your mission, Rondah?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is for you to save these souls!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall stay in Regan’s star!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This dwarf realm is only a stepping-stone
toward a higher throne. Not here is your sphere,
with bird men and women. Up there they wait
for you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He raised his hand and the clouds above them
cleared away; beyond the gold they saw Jupiter;
his fiery globe was splotched with great, glowing
surfaces of yellow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you see them? Those are my golden
lakes. The little, smooth, green moon near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>star is one of the satellites which you can save.
It is small, but three times the size of this star.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah answered nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That beautiful world has perishing multitudes.
They wait for you, Rondah! Will you lose them
their salvation for one man of Earth? You are
waiting for one merely human. I am of a race
more powerful, as my world is greater. You alone
can reveal the truths to these worlds. You must
teach them, save them. Rondah, Rondah, why
do you not look at me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>His strong, white hands clutched the air beside
her, but they could not touch the woman of Earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rondah, you are the spirit, you are my love!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you not know I do not love you?” said
Rondah, quietly. “Does one so mighty know so
little of human hearts?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All my worlds are yours. Surely, you must
take them. From their creation the scheme of
their existence was for you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a caress the light of ruby and of green fell
upon Rondah’s coronet and kissed her red-gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>braids. Her pale, perfect face was pink with the
light. Her lovely eyes burned with the glory of
both colors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will not go! I will stay in Regan’s star!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Slow, very slow, her answer, as if a sort of
paralysis had touched her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is a foe to Regan,” whispered her wifely
faith, “triumphant and gorgeous while Regan is
asleep in winter helplessness. Thank Heaven it
is the last winter!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hate you!” whispered her heart; almost her
lips uttered the words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I love you!” cried the man, with an awful
prayer in his voice. “I have waited years for a
smile or a word. I will not return to my sun
without you! Oh! come to your fate with me!
You will come, Rondah, you will come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>And now he caught her hands and turned her
reluctant eyes to look at him.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not of duty—her strength—for duty
with its care was forgotten in the dulling peace
of the Sun Island. Love’s might was asleep from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the same influence. No strength came from the
puny star on which she stood. Rondah felt the
words of this man’s speaking move her soul like
Heaven. An ambition, which was the most powerful
characteristic of her humanity, was wakened
into quick, living unrest by his picture of the glorious
world. His clinging hands seemed to hold
her as a bond miraculous. Dead—faith, hope,
trust, love—all dead with the Sun Island’s peace
and the star’s cold!</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah, it was from that Earth, that grand old Earth,
away in space, remote, lost! It was the stern,
narrow-fenced faith of her childhood which came
now and stood in her heart and made her able to
break all bonds of this unholy forging—that faith
at which Regan had scoffed so often when it upheld
Father Renaudin years before. It saved
Rondah, his wife, when she had almost forgotten
Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never! I will not come!” she said, but she
spoke so low, so hoarsely, that only the stranger
heard it. “My God, my God, help me in this
star! Come quickly, else I lose my soul!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Ah, that was a cry which it seemed all the stars
might hear. The brilliance lifted above the skylike
fog, and all the snowy wastes outside were
visible. There were troops of awakened bird
people flinging themselves in flocks against the
wall. There were ranks of elf men raging and
hammering at the wall. There was Regan awake,
desperately trying to break down the barrier.
There was Father Renaudin hastening to the spot
from the far distant palace.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah did not see that the clouds had lifted
but all the Star saw her, saw her with cries of
horror and despair, and with increase of futile
rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will go, oh, Rondah! I cannot leave you
forever! I love you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go, go!” cried Rondah. “I will never leave
the star!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was again that shuddering wail. An agony
was in its sound which woke all the other sleepers
in the snow. It was the wail of lost souls!</p>

<p class='c013'>The man turned away, dashing Rondah’s hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>from his hold. He flung shiny wings, which were
hidden ’neath his robe, into the air, and in a second
was in the clouds, his superb beauty changed to a
loathsome darkness, his face grinning and horrid,
as with his hands he clutched at her—the woman
alone on the Sun Island. He howled at her and
he shrieked at her.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sky began to flicker with lights; these
changed to seraphic faces. A thrilling, tremendous
chorus of words sounded in the air around:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blessed art thou, woman of Earth! Millions
of souls hast thou saved this day!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it faded. The air was silent. The music
of the Sun Island was dead forever.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then came a crash as of icebergs breaking.
The wall had fallen. Father Renaudin had rushed
to it and struck it with his staff of glass. The
staff fell shattered in a thousand pieces, but the
wall fell too, for the time of angels and of spirits
was past in the star. The days of its revelations
were ended. It was Rondah’s star, and other
instruments were not needed for its progression.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Regan in despair had dropped down as the
stranger had flown. The elf men, bringing
Regan, the bird men and Father Renaudin all
rushed across the lava path, which the winter convulsions
had uplifted from the water. They surrounded
Rondah. They laid Regan at her feet.
Jupiter’s day ended. Night fell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah sank upon her knees and, lifting his
head in her arms, pressed kisses on Regan’s cold
lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is dead! he is dead! Let time die, too,
that I need not leave him!” she sobbed, and a
moan of sympathy burst from the saddened hearts
of the bird women. The elf men wept and wailed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, not dead,” said Father Renaudin, “only
overcome by the helpless horror of looking. He
thought you would go. I thought you would go—the
Star and all the angels thought you would
go. It is an old, old tempter in a new sphere.
You have saved a world from falling, Rondah.
Your mission is here only. Jupiter is a fiery
ball, unfit for life except of demons.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Regan opened his eyes at last, slowly, wearily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here,” he cried, with a half-sob, “here—not
gone, not left me for a world of diamond mountains
with golden rivers!” And he clasped Rondah
in his ice-cold arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the anguish of the years in her voice,
Rondah replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not for a universe of worlds, not for Heaven,
until I must!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='large'>THE GREEN MOON.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Once more in the palace, Rondah and Regan
were happy. Father Renaudin sat beside
the fire in the silver room, engrossed in his studies.
The star—a satellite of Jupiter—in one soft, steady
reign of a new sun, began to change.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the elf men’s forest of pods a new and
superior race, though still of a small-winged,
dwarfish kind, bloomed out. From the transplanted
pods in the new fields there blossomed
wingless creatures, whose advent Regan hailed
with delight, but the cause of this phenomenon—the
absence of wings—was unsuspected until he
informed the wonder-stricken bird men that he
had amputated all wings at the time of removal
and transplanting.</p>

<p class='c013'>These differing races were not so harmonious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>as were the previous classes. The bird people
were strangely restless and cared nothing at all
for those great architectural achievements which
they had formerly been so pleased to pursue.</p>

<p class='c013'>The elf men, always a trouble, were still more
stubborn and destructive, so much so that Father
Renaudin ordered their permanent removal from
the continent to one great island of the sea, and
with the help of the huge wings of the bird people,
having reasoned them into an enthusiastic acceptance
of the gift of the great island, they were
conveyed there, where their destructive propensities
could not affect the work of the superior
races.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the pleased surprise of their scheming managers,
as soon as they absolutely possessed the isle,
instead of destroying they began to build and cultivate
their vales and decorate their mountains.
A grotesque and clumsy style of architecture was
theirs, and a gaudy and clashing selection of hues
adorned the walls, but they were proud and
triumphant, and Father Renaudin, who visited the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>new land with each week to teach and to preach,
began soon to boast of his colonists. He was a
monarch without knowing it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The interior cities were almost deserted by the
bird men. They would not even repair the
damages of the winter drift. The wingless men,
who took this labor in charge, were very slow,
but had much more judgment than their brilliant
brethren.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cause of all this restlessness of these people
seemed to be the continual rising of the beautiful
emerald moon. When it came close to the
star, the voices of the bird men made a clamor on
the vales and hills. They did not seem to fear,
although the two orbs were often dangerously
close to each other. They only seemed wild as a
fetterless flock of unreasoning birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The star was transforming itself into a dreamland.
The silver trees of diamond leaves were
transplanted from the Sun Island, and these
bloomed freely everywhere. There came to life
new forms of vegetation, new orders of annuals.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The storms of intense violence gradually died in
the air. The showers of rain became frequent
and no longer frightful.</p>

<p class='c013'>The southern lava seas so cooled that the snow
of the polar regions settled in spots upon the
islands. Earthquakes became of less power. There
were many of the boiling spots in the sea which
ceased to simmer, when one far-off island burst
into a living volcano and closed these lesser
outlets.</p>

<p class='c013'>And as the softened years thus redly glided on,
the children of man were born in the star, and
Regan’s sons and daughters played under the
silver trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>The slow improvements continued without any
material aid from the bird men. The wings which
Regan had always so hated now gave them that
supremacy which he had always foreseen. It was
fully demonstrated that a winged race were only
subject when they chose to be, “temporarily.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='large'>“FAREWELL!”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>One sunset they were all upon the lake-cooled
roof, where was the glass island with its
golden temple; the sun was bathing the star in
liquid ruby; the emerald moon, at a point seeming
nearer than ever before, came glinting its
green into their skies. There were other moons,
too, but only a single green one.</p>

<p class='c013'>The loud clamoring of the bird men was even
more emphatic than usual. It resolved itself into
words. These words were: “Farewell! farewell!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What does this mean?” exclaimed Regan,
starting to hinder them; but he returned to his
seat. They had their wings and they had spread
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>From all the vales, from all the hills they rose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>in black flocks, shadowing the palace, darkening
the air. And with the thunder of many wings
added to the music of their voices, they left the
star, sailing till they changed into a black spot,
and that soon lost to view in the distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A migration to that emerald moon,” said Father
Renaudin. “That explains their restlessness
for the past years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, and that accounts for my half-finished
cities and my slowly-built temples of commerce
and art,” said Regan. “Do not grieve, Rondah,”
he added. “They are gone, but more will soon
blossom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so,” said Father Renaudin. “Yesterday
I visited the plain and found that the southern
sea had penetrated the chasm. All the bird pods
sleep beneath hundreds of feet of water.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas! alas! My beautiful, true friends! I
did not dream that they would leave us like this!”
said Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is better so. The race of men has now possession
of the star,” said Regan. “I never liked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>those wings, those black and breathful sheets of
power. The elf men will improve into a humanity.
The wingless race is almost, if not entirely,
human. To us and to our children is the star,
Rondah!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE MYSTERY OF THE SUN ISLAND.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Of so great importance was the learning in
the books that Regan and Rondah decided
to explore the Sun Island and try to regain them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Renaudin ventured to accompany them,
although until he had entirely crossed the lava
bridge he was not certain that the prohibition concerning
his return had been removed. True, he
had once stepped upon that sacred soil, but that
was in what always seemed to him like a flash of
lightning-like desperation and most dangerous
presumption. He found no voice nor influence
commanding him to retrace his steps, and the
three proceeded to make a thorough exploration.</p>

<p class='c013'>The beautiful isle lay before them, glowing like
a gem, as much their own, it seemed, as any patch
of earthly stubble. They had not seen it for several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>busy years. It was more enchanting than of
yore. It even appeared larger. The rainbow
cloud still hung above it, but the radiance of white,
veiling light had gone with the wall. The heights
of amber and garnet were clearly defined against
the purplish sky of Jupiter. The amber palace
stood, but no books were there.</p>

<p class='c013'>For some days they had climbed the cliffs and
penetrated to the ravines, when they were astonished
to find near the sea a huge garnet gate.
That it had been cut by men’s handicraft from
a cliff near by they could see. It was hinged and
bolted with silver.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was open.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have found the secret of the isle!” exclaimed
Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I doubt not we have found one of the secrets
of the universe!” answered Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But,” slowly said Rondah, “shall we go in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not? No death in the star!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I may not see my little children for many
years!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“They are safe where there is no danger.
Come!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The two, Father Renaudin and Rondah, stood
hesitating, looking at the strength of the gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of what are you two afraid?” asked Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That the gate will shut!” answered both together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Destiny is! Come!” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>They descended the hewn stairs; as they went
into the depths of the star they heard the gate
shut with a clang.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What fate may unbar it?” said Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be sure something will unlock it for us,” said
Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has been built by humanity,” said Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ever-surging sea was silent. The roar of
the many volcanoes was not heard.</p>

<p class='c013'>They soon found that the air and lights in the
underground realm existed independently of any
outside atmosphere or illumination. At intervals
hung above them meteors of large size, which
whitely blazed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>For a long distance their uninterrupted progress
was through great garnet halls. Then they came
into a vast cavern of silver. Silver was everywhere,
either frosted or shining. Among supporting
columns and through branching tunnels they
searched, until they came to a small, round door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The gate to Heaven!” whispered Regan, and
now he paused and dared  not enter upon the field
before him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here Father Renaudin was brave. Notwithstanding
his revelations, the sudden sight of these
things made him believe that Gregg Dempster
had prepared for them this miracle of brilliance
and left it for their delight.</p>

<p class='c013'>They crept through the door and stood gazing
in bewilderment, unable, among the reflections of
light, to see where to go. For far before them
swept into distance a moving, whispering sea,
which was of no water ever known before. It
was a tossing sheet of emerald and fire; glittering
gems sweeping in liquid flames rolled in long
smooth swells to fall in music at their feet.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The shore around was like frost of winter.
Many blazing meteors whitened all with brilliance.
A palace built by hands stood beside the waters.
It had doors made of the silver trees which grew
outside on the island. When Regan saw this he
began to recover his presence of mind, for never
before on the star had he been so utterly confounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then came toward them a giant man. His
robes were of jewel-covered fabric. He was most
noble, and looked at them with gentlest eyes from
a strong, calm face. He held out his hand. As
they approached, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“For this hour the star has whirled. This is
the measure of a cycle. Fear no further!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he called, and from the palace came hundreds
of people, yes, very people of Earth. They
were strangely glorified, but men and women, who
cried out, in glad acclaim, “The time is here at
last!” and who looked with delighted countenances
upon these three.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The long years have passed,” said one.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“They speak as men,” said Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said the man who towered in majesty
so superior to any that he could not be supposed
to belong to the same race. “Listen while I tell
you the secret of the Sun Island and how it came
to be here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He moved his hand and a number of boys came
forward and scattered upon the white rocks baskets
of blossoms, making banks of flowers on which the
three seated themselves while the man told them
as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“In time primeval, before the sun with its
attendant worlds was spoken into being, where
now we whirl, on this tiny orb, there rolled two
stupendous, peopled worlds more vast than
Jupiter. On these dwelt such as I, men whose
lives were prolonged for ages. We reasoned for
cycles. We built for great periods. We had
years granted until we learned too much and grew
weary of our knowledge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But woe and sin and hate, intensified in evil
according to the size of the field and the capacity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>of the race, existed with us. For centuries my
life was only part of a splendid pageant. Then I
became troubled at the misery around me. I
devoted my time to the unfortunate. Oh, there
were so many! Their relief became the only
pleasure of my life. I heard the prophecies
about me. I noted the signs of impending
disaster. I even heard the creaking of the
sinews of our old world, and saw the continents
being deserted for life beyond; but I was so busy.
I hastened to get to a few more nations, and before
I was there, while I was saying, ‘Some other time
I will lay down my life,’ the globes, like two
bubbles in air, burst into millions of fragments and
my existence was indefinitely prolonged.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Previously we had been instructed by agencies
of a supernatural character, but I was vouchsafed
no explanation, neither granted any instruction.
On this fragment—a patch of my world—I floated
for some chaotic cycles—somewhere! anywhere!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I saw your sun, with worlds, called into
that place where before all had been dark. Ages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>oh, ages ago, my island dashed into the mass of
hot vapor wherein were floating in steam Earth’s
oceans, for then the gaseous ball was very large.
Later, I saw the oceans fall upon lava, to be sent
off in clouds. I saw continents form, like black
ice in scarlet seas, and saw them dashed into pieces
to leave no record.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw such forests as these on the star, and
saw them with their hot marshes sunken under
temporary seas. I began to wonder why was all
this. Time became a long sorrow to me. The
Earth was a break in its monotony, and when it
became the abode of man I could scarce endure
my long exile. For each short visit I must away
to Saturn’s kingdom out in distance. With farseeing
eyes, such as we have, I could look through
some years, and see the deeds and also read the
hearts of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The souls on earth were as a page to me. All
schemes in lives or mysteries of nature I could
understand. I could recite to you long histories
of the pre-Adamites. I saw the glory of Atlantis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>before the oceans submerged it. Its wisdom was
superior to that of the race now on Earth, its
achievement beyond all later achievement. So
like gods grew those men that the Earth trembled
at their power, and the mandate went forth to
destroy their wicked brilliance and unpeople
almost all the Earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I looked at the burnish of its wealth
and saw its miraculous prosperity, I bethought
me to fly down and save a few souls from the
doomed land. With a great air-ship, such as we
used in my world, I gathered from the Earth a few,
and these are their descendants. Then there was
a removal of oceans, an uplifting of other areas.
The learning of ages, the temples of nations slept
under the sun as I neared the Earth, and slept
under the water as I left.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the fragment was too small for us and I
bethought me to capture a half-cooled ball of lava
not far away. By means of heavy chains and  air-ships I hitched my island to this star, and later
grafted its roots into the soil. According to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>law of my great sphere, the lesser plant began at
once to absorb the greater, and then it was
revealed to me that when the Sun Island had
extended over the entire star, absorbing all the
lava substance, transforming all the seas to emerald
and flame, I might proceed to realms more fair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I still watched Earth, through the glory into
which the history of Egypt dies, into the progress
of moderns where hope of history lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>“More than a thousand souls I influenced from
time to time. At last, there was born in an
English hamlet a boy, Gregg Dempster. His
mother died with a mad prayer on her lips: ‘Let
him not worship gold! Oh, take him to another,
easier world than this!’ In all the years I had
not heard so simple a prayer uttered with so awful
power of death. From his cradle I watched the
child through friendless youth, loveless manhood,
monomaniac age, and saw him in abject poverty,
yet ever shielded from the greatest grief of men.
Often I urged him on, often I taught him secrets,
often I gave him courage. I spoke when he lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>upon his bier. It was not he. I stood here to
meet him when he came first upon the star. I
walled for him the Sun Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, Regan, my eyes saw you forsaken in
the forest, with your little sister in a wilderness.
Your mother prayed not but cast herself to death.
I thought, ‘Where is some man to save these
souls?’ Father Renaudin had had no visions then.
While you and Isabella sobbed in the forest, she
freezing and you despairing, I lighted for Father
Renaudin that vision of his duty which flashed
into his eyes and burned into his soul. It made
him shake off his habit of slothful luxury, and
sent him to where you stood. That very night
he found good homes for both of you. Do you
remember that, Regan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall remember that when the suns have
grown cold!” answered Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I noted that, with all your heavy curse, the
curse of the father and the curse of the mother
also, you were yet strangely noble. You chose for
yourself the humble home of poverty, and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>all the brightness of life to your sister. I wondered
would you too forget. Through the imposed
silence concerning the relationship I saw you
always faithful, always in human love bound
beyond power of separation to sever. I was near
you when you fought your path through disgrace
and poverty in life. In your deepest troubles, in
your darkest disgrace, I was there, but I could not
excuse your course. I could only pity your weakness
and remember the curse of the father, the
curse of the father!</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did not note Rondah until she came, like a
ministering spirit, to care for Gregg Dempster
when he was near death. The prayer of Gregg
Dempster’s mother was answered from Heaven.
Father Renaudin and yourself I watched and
aided. Rondah was blessed by the kindness of
the angel-man!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You came to me,” said Father Renaudin,
“when I stood on the cliff and with despairing
misery looked over the star. You whispered in
the air: ‘Man, you have dreamed a god’s dream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>with human strength! You have been given a
field where humanity can accomplish the godlike
dream!’ It was time for you to come. My soul
fainted, my faith faltered!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it was time. Humanity has so little faith.
It has so little revelation. But from this time on
I may reveal much. Come!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They walked along the shore of the emerald
sea, the people of Earth about them, but like an
angelhood. Wisdom of deathless years was in
their eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From what a race are we degenerate!” said
Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To what a height may we not rise!” answered
Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rondah had not been so long from Earth as to
feel so keenly the wonder as she mingled with a
crowd of mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before them rose a white-walled city; into its
streets they walked. The old song was in the air,
the song of the Sun Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beyond were fields of sapphire blue, each leaf
with the slightest touch of gold upon it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“These are our fields; these are our seas; here
is our city; humanity is our people,” said their
guide. “See here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They looked to see where the roots of silver
had crowded the lava above the branching stems.
Seeing them entirely bewildered at the ideas so
swiftly presented to them, the man of the old world
said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you not understand? Do you know how
a coral builds an island? Can you not believe
that a world may be a plant, and a plant may
have animal life? They almost, if not quite,
approach to it even in your Earth. The star
belongs to your sun, but our world was the property
of another sun and had a different order to
follow. The great ball could think and move, and
when we too deeply wrought its brilliant breast,
it groaned with an awful voice. We were not
astonished at that, as were you, in horror, when
the island cried aloud. Look here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They saw the ocean, drop by drop, falling
through the silver rocks into the emerald sea.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“How long shall I be here?” mused the guide.
“Until, drop by drop, the sea of the Sun Island
has swallowed the seas of the star! How many
drops are there in your seas, Regan? When they
are all gone you will be sole monarch of the most
lovely star whirling in this portion of the heavenly
constellations!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me tell you what you are destined to do
here. Not to dwell with bird people nor to wait
for the development of elf men. Here is your
own race. You have now to select for your outside
world twelve such as you choose, and of these
will be the kingdoms of the future. Look never
for a human soul to evolve from a vegetable nor
to rise into the body of a goblin elf man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the star floats you shall teach it all things;
make better laws than ever Earth dreamed of;
create a paradise! Man should learn to lay each
stone to stand for a thousand years. Your records
should be on walls of amber, not in books of
silver.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Among the bird people there is no sin, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the human race is still burdened with its taint.
When the star is builded with colossal cities, the
sea spanned with silver bridges, the hills scintillating
with diamond forests, whether or not sin be
eradicated remains with you, Regan. Rondah has
saved all the bird people; to save humanity is for
the king of the star! Come yet further!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a giant marble statue given a life he
seemed as he moved in grandeur, the radiance of
his robes blinding them. The crowd about were
wrapped in cloud-mist of pink, and folds of rainbow
were their draperies. The music of the
many footfalls was like the tinkling of numberless
silver bells.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would you see a remembrance of the pre-Adamites?”</p>

<p class='c013'>There rose before them a vision of altars, robed
priests and cloudy incense, flowers, gold, mystery
of musical incantation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is one of the old fair scenes of worship.
So did primeval man worship a mystery above
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Then the vision fled. Another rose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is my world! Oh, blessed home!” said
the man of might.</p>

<p class='c013'>They looked on works of such magnitude that
the surface of the star had not been able to uphold
them—steeds of immense strength and majestic
in motion, vehicles moving a thousand men at
once. As this vision also vanished, Regan asked:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is then our Earth so inferior?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In size and in beauty, yes; in revelation from
God blessed above many others.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then rose their star as it was to look in the
future.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The dearest land of all!” exclaimed Rondah.
“Parzelia!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What moving thing is that? What crosses in
those swallowing waters?” cried Regan. “Is it
a ship for my seas at last?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why need a ship where silver bridges span
all channels?” and the man laughed, which
strangely shocked them all till they remembered
he was not a god. He was even no angel. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>island grew as a plant; the visions might be the
product of any mind which had had so long to
invent. A holier man of greater length of life.
This only.</p>

<p class='c013'>And still in the picture moved the immense
vehicle safely through the sea. The sides were
veiled in silver and diamond foliage. Sometimes
the water surged on its sides, sometimes it was
hidden behind smoke of volcano. It moved on.
Then Regan saw stone paws stamping in the
water heavily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is the island—the island, which lives!” cried
he, in triumph.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Man of Earth, that is the last of this kind of
revelation,” said the man of might. “Remember
well all I shall show you, for after the gate closes
when you return to the outer star it will never
be again unbarred! It will be a barrier as impassable
as the gulf which separates the lost from
happiness! I, under the star, you, upon it, will
have our separate existences from now forever!
When I depart, you will not know, you will never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>hear a whisper of our life again! Therefore learn
now. The island shall take you to volcanic
south or to north no longer arctic. It shall carry
your colonists to every land where Jupiter shines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See the faint remembrances of my former
life! I have made all the models very much
smaller than they were of old!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they entered a great building and looked
on mysteries innumerable, and on devices for
purposes unknown, superseding all earthly art.
Machines were there which walked through mountains
to tunnel them, others for lifting a continent,
if the feat were necessary; machines for flying,
contrivances for communicating with other
spheres. These were a few among the many of
which they could comprehend the use, but not the
principle. There were walls of lace-work in gold,
temples of lace-work in amber, masses of gem-sheened
fabrics, piles of jewels, long lines of
golden statuary, and marvels of wind harps with
pipes to make mystic music without hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they were weary the man said: “Come
float on the sea!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>A circular boat of silver and sailed with pink
clouds came to meet them. Around the circular
edge sat fifty red-robed oarsmen, wearing high
white caps all glinting with gems; they moved
the boat across the sea by means of paddles of
circular sheets of hammered silver, fastened upon
the ends of long staves of blue pearl. The craft
was in two sections. The central part was a half-sphere
of amber separate from the rest and merely
floated by its encircling. On this was a silver
canopy where they reposed to watch the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>They paused before a length of smooth rising
shore, and there were assembled the shimmering
multitudes, hailing in earthly voices the advent of
the earth-king, Regan. Each one was in robes of
jeweled cloth, for it was a gala day. Twelve were
to be chosen to go outside the gates, and each one
desired to be one of the twelve. They had been
happy there for ages, in their constantly expanding
kingdom, but they were human and they
wanted change. And another thing, they wanted
the glory of building a world, for they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>of the Atlantean race. They moved like flashes
of light.</p>

<p class='c013'>A group of seers was admitted upon the craft
to bring to Father Renaudin books of great importance,
sealed bottles of amber, curious flasks
of medicines and boxes of precious perfumes.
These were laid most reverently at his feet, and,
amid his thanks, the seers, with obeisance, moved
away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would there were more of these compounds
and mixtures,” said the man of the old world.
“They are powerful and most necessary. I have
not been able to remember a millionth part of the
alchemy of old, there were so many things to do,
there was so much which I did not prepare. If I
had only had more time, it would have been better!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And were you,” asked Rondah, “you, who
lived for cycles, hurried in your lifetime?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes! I could not do half. I left all my
noblest dreams unrealized; my highest hopes
proved fruitless!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Impossible!” sighed Father Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shall we accomplish our mission? Shall we
bring a finished life’s work to a world’s end?”
asked Rondah.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never! never! Eternity is too short to finish
the endless labor of a universe! I doubt if God
Himself has ever ended his work! From time
beginningless to time eternal the march of labor
goes on, from little sphere to larger, from lesser
soul to greater, from duller intellect to one more
brilliant! It is the changeless law for men and for
angels alike! Onward, ceaselessly move onward,
is the united aim of all dissevered instruments!</p>

<p class='c013'>“There can come no pause. No man has ever
moved an iota back since chaotic universes were
spoken into moveless black of horrified space. Nor
demon, nor angel, nor God on high has stopped
the course, from its accomplished lower task on
the path to do its unfinished higher task, of atom
or of sun since first the blistering balls of howling,
hissing fire were whirled away upon their
non-clashing cycles. There is no end to labor!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Labor is the duty of suns! Labor is the delight
of Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When shall I chain my star? When may I
drive it like the isle? When may I say to adverse
fate, ‘Stand still?’” asked Regan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When you have eradicated sin from the hearts
of all this humanity, now removed from the curse
of Earth, when you shall have grown more aged
and more wise than am I, for I cannot do that,”
answered their guide; “no, I cannot do that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the limit of our power?” asked Father
Renaudin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no bound to what knowledge humanity
may attain, save the clog of sin! Time,
strength and study will overcome all other barriers!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monarch of Fate is man! Man yet shall chain
the stars; shall drive the harnessed worlds!”
said Regan Farmington.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Nana</i>” and “<i>L’Assommoir</i>” are the greatest as well as the most powerful and wonderful novels
ever written. They have created a great sensation everywhere, as the literary event of the century,
over five hundred thousand copies of “<i>Nana</i>” and “<i>L’Assommoir</i>” having been sold in Paris alone.
Zola is literally true to life in his powerful delineations. His books are immortal because they are true.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>“Rondah; or, Thirty-three Years in a Star,” a peculiarly fascinating and absorbing
novel by Florence Carpenter Dieudonné, is written in the fruitful vein of fancy
and mystery opened by H. Rider Haggard in “She” and “King Solomon’s Mines,”
but in many points surpasses those weird and popular romances. It is exceedingly
clever and brilliant. The plot is ingenuity itself, and the incidents are strange and
inexplicable enough to satisfy the strongest craving for the marvellous. In fact, the
entire book is but a progression from one marvel to another, each succeeding episode
distancing its predecessors in the element of wonder until the climax is reached in the
disclosure of the mysteries and dazzling magnificence of that truly astounding spot, the
Sun Island. Gregg Dempster, a visionary hermit, has discovered a little star, an uncooled
planet yet in process of formation, and a mysterious method of reaching it. His
friend Regan gains possession of his secret and the hermit dies. Regan, Roy Lee, Isabella,
Rondah and Father Renaudin, a venerable priest, are in Dempster’s hut during
a storm while the hermit’s corpse is yet lying there. Regan watches for the critical
moment. It comes. He puts Rondah out of doors and the four remaining personages
are whirled away to the star, where they meet with numerous wonderful adventures and
experiences. Rondah is subsequently conveyed to the star and participates in many
intensely weird and dramatic scenes. To the supernatural phases of the novel the author
has added mortal love, hate, jealousy and enthusiasm, employing them with rare art and
effect. The star’s luxuriant summer with its wealth of vegetation and its icy winter of
twenty years are graphically pictured. The natives are mostly bird people, winged and
of vegetable growth, and over them Regan reigns as king. “Rondah” is crisply and
vigorously written, and its special charm is the realistic way in which its wonders are
depicted, an air of probability being maintained throughout all its marvellous incidents.
That everybody will read and vastly relish it goes without saying.</i></p>

    <div class='c003'>EPISODES IN THE LIFE OF MARY CAMPBELL.</div>
    <div class='c003'>FACTS, NOT FANCIES.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY MRS. HARRIET N. K. GOFF.</div>
    <div class='c003'>WITH AN INTRODUCTION</div>
    <div>BY REV. DR. THEODORE L. CUYLER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>“Who Cares?” is a book which every one should read, especially every one who
desires to promote social purity. It is the autobiography of a Magdalen, the casting
out of whose devils was clearly followed by the inbreathing of the Divine Spirit which
gives the healed the power to become the healer. Mary Campbell, like the Mary Magdalen
of Scripture, became possessed of seven times the blessed spirit of ministration
which most people have after the seven devils were cast out of her. She was a child of
inharmonious parentage—of a cultured though vicious and cruel father, and an ignorant
and passionate mother. No love in her home, but gross cruelty and hardship
abounded, rendered yet more unendurable by outcroppings of refinement inherited
from remote ancestry. Begotten, as she and her brother and sisters were, of depraved
desires only, and thus tainted in the substratum of their natures, reared without love,
though hungering for it, and in poverty that was utter destitution of all that either
soul, body, or heart could crave, the sound sense and strength of mind and native
ability evinced in Mary’s narrative prove clearly that to her fell a large portion of the
heritage of her paternal grandmother, and that her reformation was deep and real.
The story was written while Death glared into the very face of the poor girl whose secret
wore her life out; indeed, it was finished almost with her expiring breath. Hers was
a soul at one with its Maker, and terribly alive to the miseries of those in the horrible
pit whence she was rescued. The “great cry of her soul” commends the book to every
lover of humanity, every father, mother, mistress, young man and young woman, the
influential and the friendless, the Christian and the Christless, the law-maker and the
law-breaker, and each will find a lesson there, which will “make for good.” The
reader is held spellbound from the first page to the last, and cannot close the volume
without knowing himself possessed of new thoughts, clearer views, higher aims, better
understanding and broader charity to aid in answering the question: “Who Cares?”
Poor Mary, of blessed memory now! “Poor Kate” and “Poor little Maggie!” What
else could have been expected? The Woman’s Christian Temperance Unions should
have the book, the White Cross army and the Black Cross army, male and female.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
